- The mean for the LARGE group is overall larger than that of the SMALL group however, The S. D. for the SMALL group is smaller than that of the LARGE group suggesting a tighter spread of values within the SMALL group compared to the LARGE group

- The IQR (size of box) is notably smaller for the SMALL group compared to the LARGE group, this is the same conclusion we came to from looking at the descriptive statistics in part (a). The median for the LARGE group is also notably higher up (larger) than that of the SMALL group. They are both right-skewed as the median is closer to the bottom of the box and the upper whisker is longer than the bottom. The recommended mesure of central tendency for both of them is the median as it is less affected by skew and outliers because they are both skewed. There are no outliers as SPSS identifies none by the $1.5 \times IQR$ Rule. Non-symmetrical box plots also suggest non-normality and

- Since the points on both plots __do not__ stay roughly close to the line we can assume the data __is not__ roughly normal.

(d)

- The assumptions are as follows, 
	- Normality - This is violated as shown in part (c) and (b)
	- Random sampling - We __do not__ have random sampling
	- Independence - We can assume the data is independent from the study design
	- Equal variances - We can assume equal variances from the fact that the box plots have roughly equal spreads
