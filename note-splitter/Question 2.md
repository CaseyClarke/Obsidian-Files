# Question 2

(a)

- (i) 
	- A t-test is the most appropriate where the sample is $\mu_{2019}$
- (ii) 
	- $H_0 : \mu_{2019} = 279$
	- $H_A : \mu_{2019} \neq 279$
- (iii) 
	- $\text{Estimate} = \bar{y} = 305.72$
	- $\mu = 279$
	- $s = 40.05$
	- $n = 12$
	- $SE(\bar{y}) = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{40.05}{\sqrt{12}} = 11.5614$
	- $t = \frac{\bar{y}- \mu}{SE(\bar{y})} = \frac{305.72- 279}{11.5614} = 2.31113$
- (iv)
	- $df = n-1 = 11$
	- $p \in  (0.04, 0.05) \implies$ strong to moderate evidence against $H_0$
	- $p < a = 0.05 \implies$ we reject the null hypothesis 
- (v)
	- At a significance level of $0.05$ we reject the claim that the average cost of residential electrical bills in 2019 is the same as the average cost of residential electrical bills in 2017

(b)

- Variables are carried over from the previous part, only change is $a = 0.01$

- (i)
	- $C.V. = t^*_{df,a/2} = t^*_{11,0.005} = 3.106$
- (ii)
	- $\bar{y} \pm  t^*_{11,0.005}SE({\bar{y}}) = 305.72 \pm  (3.106)11.5614 = (269.8103, 341.6297)$
- (iii) 
	- given that $279$ is in the confidence interval we can say with $99\%$ confidence that there is insufficient evidence to conclude a difference between the two means

(c)

- They gave different conclusions as part(a) had a much less strict confidence level compared to part (b), the strength of the evidence did not change, just our level of confidence
