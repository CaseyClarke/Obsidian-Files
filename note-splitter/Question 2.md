- HT seems to be the best strategy and C seems to be the worst just based off of comparing the means.

- The standard deviations stay roughly in the range of $(7, 9.5)$ and the ratio of the largest vs. the smallest standard deviations is about $1.3626$ meaning that we can safely assume equal variablity is satisified

C: Skewed - slightly left
H: Symmetric but with an outlier
HT: Roughly Symmetric
Q: Roughly Symmetric
QT: Roughly Symmetric
T Skewed - slightly right

The centers are vastly different

There is a lot of variance in the spreads and centers of the boxplots and there is an outlier in the H group. Given that the groups are only slightly skewed at max and there is only one outlier we can assume that normaility is preserved

All of the plots seem roughly normal, the dots stay close to the trend line and it is roughly $45Â°$

If the assumption of normality was violated it would pose a signifigant problem as it it a requirement for the following statistical tests and would affect the results greatly
