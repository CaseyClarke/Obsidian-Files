# Question 4

(a)

- (i)

	- $\gamma_H = \frac{(\mu_2 - \mu_1) + (\mu_5 - \mu_4)}{2} = -\frac12 \mu_1 + \frac 12 \mu_2 + 0\mu_3 -\frac12 \mu_4 + \frac12 \mu_5 + 0 \mu_6$

- (ii)

	- $\gamma_Q = \frac{(\mu_3 - \mu_1) + (\mu_6 - \mu_4)}{2} = -\frac12 \mu_1 + 0\mu_2 + \frac12 \mu_3 -\frac12 \mu_4 + 0 \mu_5 + \frac12 \mu_6$
- 
- (iii)

	- $\gamma_T = \frac{(\mu_4 - \mu_1) + (\mu_5 - \mu_2) + (\mu_6 - \mu_3)}{3}$
	- $\Rightarrow -\frac13 \mu_1 + -\frac13 \mu_2  -\frac13 \mu_3 + \frac13  \mu_4 + \frac13 \mu_5 + \frac13 \mu_6$

- For homework assignments:
	- The midterm scores were on average affected by the value of contrast which is $13.18$ grade points
	- The standard error is $1.467$
	- The test statistic is high at $t = 8.984$
	- The p value is very low at $p < 0.001$
	- All of this points to the fact that homework assignments have a high effect on the midterm scores
- For weekly quizzes:
	- The midterm scores were on average affected by the value of contrast which is $1.07$ grade points
	- The standard error is $1.467$
	- The test statistic is low at $t = 0.727$
	- The p value is high at $p = 0.468$
	- All of this points to the fact that weekly quizzes have a very low effect on midterm scores
- For computer tutorials:
	- The coefficients for this contrast were multiplied by 3 when inputted into SPSS so the Value of contrast and St. Error are divided by 3 when reported here
	- The midterm scores were on average affected by the value of contrast which is $6.543$ grade points
	- The standard error is $1.198$
	- The test statistic fairly high at $t = 5.462$
	- The p value is very low at $p < 0.001$
	- All of this points to the fact that computer tutorials have a medium effect on the midterm scores

- Homework assignments are the most influential and weekly quizzes are the least influential, most evident by comparing the Value of Contrast for the 3 types

(c)

- $95\% \text{ CI}_H = \text{ Value of Contrast} \pm SE(\gamma_H)t^*_{df} = 13.18 \pm 1.467(1.660) = (10.745, 15.615)$ 

- We estimate with $95\%$ confidence that the mean effect of homework assignments on midterm scores is between $(10.745, 15.615)$ i.e. we estimate with $95\%$ confidence that having homework assignments increased the average midterm score by $(10.745, 15.615)$ compared to those who didn't


(d)

- $\gamma_{H-Q} = \gamma_H - \gamma_Q = 0 \mu_1 + \frac 12 \mu_2 -\frac12\mu_3 -0 \mu_4 + \frac12 \mu_5  - \frac12 \mu_6$
-  $90\% \text{ CI}_{H-Q} = \text{ Value of Contrast} \pm SE(\gamma_{H-Q})t^*_{df} = 12.12 \pm 1.467(1.290) = (10.228, 14.012)$ 

- We estimate with $90\%$ confidence that the difference in the effects of homework assignments and computer tutorials on midterm scores is between $(10.228, 14.012)$ i.e. we estimate with $90\%$ confidence that having homework assignments increased the average midterm score by $(10.228, 14.012)$ compared to those who had computer tutorials
