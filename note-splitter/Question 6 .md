# Question 6 


Multiplicitive identity:
- $1_R1_R = 1_R = 1_R1_R$
- $1_R \in U$ as it is its own inverse

Closure:
- $uv(v^{-1}u^{-1}) = 1_R = (v^{-1}u^{-1})uv$
- $uv \in U$ as $v^{-1}u^{-1}$ is it's inverse

Multiplicitive inverse:
- $u \in U \implies uu^{-1} = 1_R = u^{-1}u$
- $u^{-1} \in U$ as $u$ is it's inverse
