# Question 1

(a)

- The population of interest is high school math students, the subjects are 180 grade 12 math students from a large high school. The response variable is midterm scores. The factor is teaching strategies, the levels are as follows:
	- Group 1: C (control group, only lecture notes and discussion)
	- Group 2: H (control plus weekly homework assignments)
	- Group 3: Q (control plus weekly quizzes)
	- Group 4: T (control plus computer tutorials)
	- Group 5: HT (control plus weekly homework as well as computer tutorials)
	- Group 6: QT (control plus weekly quizzes well as computer tutorials)

(b)

- Since this is an experiment but with random allocation we can make casual inferences
- Population inferences are not possible as the sample was only from one grade of math students not all of the grades in high school and there was no random sampling.
