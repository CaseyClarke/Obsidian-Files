- The means and S.D. for both groups are closer together than in Q2 (a), this suggests that they both have a tight spread and similar central tendency. The LARGE group has a slightly wider spread than that of the SMALL group however.

- The medians are similar for both plots however, the LARGE group has slightly higher median than the SMALL group. The IQR of both plots are very similar but again the LARGE group's IQR is slightly larger, the same conclusion we came to in part (a). They are now both slightly left skewed although less skewed than before the log transformation.  The recommended mesure of central tendency is still the median as the distributions are still skewed. There are no outliers as SPSS identifies none by the $1.5 \times IQR$ Rule

- Both plots follow the line very closely so we can be very confidence of the assumption of normality, far more than the version before the log transform

(d)

- It seemed as if the log transformation "smoothed out" the data, the variances became smaller, the skewness was reduced, and the data became more normal
