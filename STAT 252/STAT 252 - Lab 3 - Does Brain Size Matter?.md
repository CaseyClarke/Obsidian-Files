# Question 1

(a)

- The purpase of this study is as described in the abstract,  "to examine the relationship between brain size and intelligence for a random sample of university students."
- Response variables:
	- $PID$

- Explanatory variables:
	- $MRI$
	- $SEX$
	- $WEIGHT$


(b)

>The study was conducted at a large southwestern university in USA. Researchers randomly selected a sample of 40 students from a larger pool of right-handed Anglo introductory psychology students, who had indicated no history of alcoholism, unconsciousness, brain damage, epilepsy, or heart disease and had volunteered to participate in the study.  ... With prior approval of the University's research review board, students selected for MRI were required to obtain prorated full-scale IQs of greater than 130 or less than 103, and were equally divided by sex and IQ classification.

- The selection criteria were very specific so definining a population to generalize the results to would be very difficult and would proabaly not be very useful.

- I think that they chose people on the extreme ends of the IQ spectrum to more easily detect patterns, if they allowed people with more average IQ's they would have to deal with natrual variability affecting their results more.

(c)

- Causal inferences cannot be established as this study is observational not experimental

- Some factors that could effect IQ scores are:
	- Education
	- Genetics
	- External factors while taking test (Health, Hunger, Tiredness, etc.)
	- Adeptness at test taking

- Some methods for controling for these factors would be:
	- Random sampling and more samples
	- Larger candidate pool
	- Group participants by factors like education level as to isolate the effects

# Question 2

This graph shows a very roughly linear relationship with medium spread and an overall positive correlation, thus showing moderate evidence of a relationship between brain size and weight

(b)

For both males and females when we split the graph apart we see a far less clear relationship between the two variables and in terms of overall trends females tend to be lower in weight and brain size and males tend to be heavier and have bigger brain size across the board

Females:
- This graph shows a very roughly linear relationship with large spread and an overall positive correlation, thus showing weak evidence of a correlation

Males:
- Little to no evidence of a relationship, the shape is almost a cluster or circle, very weak evidence of a correlation

For part (a):
- Overall it seems as if i was correct, there does appear to be evidence of a relationship as the pearson correlation coefficent was positive and signifigant at $\alpha = 0.05$

For part (b)
- Again it seems as if i was mostly correct, females show a weaker correlation than the overall graph and males show almost no correlation at all

(b)

Females:
- Weak linear relationship positive correlation and large spread

Males:
- Weak linear relationship postive correlation and large spread, steeper slope than females

The relationship with males is signifigant at $\alpha = 0.05$ and shows strong evidence of a correlation after controlling for weight

The relationship with females is not signifigant at $\alpha = 0.05$ and shows a weak evidence of a correlation after controlling for weight

When pooling the two genders together it is signifigant at $\alpha = 0.05$ and the partial correlation coefficient is $0.439$

Males have higher mean PIQ than Females and they also have higher standard deviation than females, e.g. higher spread
