# Question 1

(a)

- The purpase of this study is as described in the abstract,  "to examine the relationship between brain size and intelligence for a random sample of university students."
- Response variables:
	- $PID$

- Explanatory variables:
	- $MRI$
	- $SEX$
	- $WEIGHT$


(b)

>The study was conducted at a large southwestern university in USA. Researchers randomly selected a sample of 40 students from a larger pool of right-handed Anglo introductory psychology students, who had indicated no history of alcoholism, unconsciousness, brain damage, epilepsy, or heart disease and had volunteered to participate in the study.  ... With prior approval of the University's research review board, students selected for MRI were required to obtain prorated full-scale IQs of greater than 130 or less than 103, and were equally divided by sex and IQ classification.

- The selection criteria were very specific so definining a population to generalize the results to would be very difficult and would proabaly not be very useful.

- I think that they chose people on the extreme ends of the IQ spectrum to more easily detect patterns, if they allowed people with more average IQ's they would have to deal with natrual variability affecting their results more.

(c)

- Causal inferences cannot be established as this study is observational not experimental

- Some factors that could effect IQ scores are:
	- Education
	- Genetics
	- External factors while taking test (Health, Hunger, Tiredness, etc.)
	- Adeptness at test taking

- Some methods for controling for these factors would be:
	- Random sampling and more samples
	- Larger candidate pool
	- Group participants by factors like education level as to isolate the effects

This graph shows a very roughly linear relationship with medium spread and an overall positive correlation, thus showing moderate evidence of a relationship between brain size and weight

(b)

> ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcsY9x6EzZn3JCUCcBDWNdEw4GZQOWiBpW3e0fkbZvPTXKqhMm9TP0zJXAIaJtVU18n_e-Z7upbrhlKo14mKS-AkqkZiZOSdwAL2Ncqx-nk-PieqQadusjla8g8xvXUGxhJxGI4?key=VJ35wvjewSyDYVqgnxnVaPm8)

For both males and females when we split the graph apart we see a far less clear relationship between the two variables and in terms of overall trends females tend to be lower in weight and brain size and males tend to be heavier and have bigger brain size across the board

Females:
- This graph shows a very roughly linear relationship with large spread and an overall positive correlation, thus showing weak evidence of a correlation

Males:
- Little to no evidence of a relationship, the shape is almost a cluster or circle, very weak evidence of a correlation

For part (a):
- Overall it seems as if i was correct, there does appear to be evidence of a relationship as the pearson correlation coefficent was positive and signifigant at $\alpha = 0.05$

For part (b)
- Again it seems as if i was mostly correct, females show a weaker correlation than the overall graph and males show almost no correlation at all

The relationship with males is signifigant at $\alpha = 0.05$ and shows strong evidence of a correlation after controlling for weight

The relationship with females is not signifigant at $\alpha = 0.05$ and shows a weak evidence of a correlation after controlling for weight

When pooling the two genders together it is signifigant at $\alpha = 0.05$ and the partial correlation coefficient is $0.439$

Males have higher mean PIQ than Females and they also have higher standard deviation than females, e.g. higher spread

We can assume equal variances from the $\frac{SD_1}{SD_2} \leq 2$ rule

$H_0: \mu_{F} = \mu_{M}$
$H_A : \mu_{F} \neq \mu_{M}$

$t = -0.16$
$p = 0.874$

Distribution under null hypothesis is a $t$ distribution with $df = 38$

Given the very high p value we can conclude that at $\alpha = 0.05$ we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is a signifigant difference in the mean PIQ between males and females

$\hat{PIQ} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}sex = 110.450 + 1.150(sex)$

The intercept is equal to the mean of Female PIQ $(110.45)$
The sum of the slope and intercept is equal to the mean of Male PIQ $111.6$

This makes sense as when $sex = 0 \; (Female)$ the regression equation becomes $110.450 + 1.150(0) = 110.450$
and when $sex = 1 \; (Male)$ the regression equation becomes $110.450 + 1.150(1) = 111.6$
this is just showing that the equation correctly models the regression

(d)

The p value for this test comes from the 2nd row in the Coefficents table in the previous question $(p = 0.874)$

This is the exact same p value as part b as this regression testing if the SEX variable slope is equal to zero is the exact same as testing if there is any difference in the means between males and females, the exact test performed in part b

# Question 5

(a)

$\mu(PIQ|MRI) = \beta_0 + \beta_1(MRI) + \varepsilon$

The model assumptions are as follows:
- Linearity
- Homoscedasticity
- Normality
- Independance
- No Serious Outliers

(b)

$\hat{PIQ} = 1.744 + 0.00012(MRI)$

As we increase $MRI$ by one unit on average $PIQ$ will increase by $\hat{\beta_1} =0.00012$
When $MRI = 0$ we expect our $PIQ$ value to be $\hat{\beta_0} = 1.744$


(c)

This is given by $R^2$ which from the model summary in the previous question is $0.150$
meaning that about $15 \%$ of the variation in $PIQ$ is explained by $MRI$

(d)

$H_0: \beta_1 = 0$
$H_A: \beta_1 \neq 0$

$t = 2.586$
$p = 0.014$

Distribution under null hypothesis is a $t$ distribution with $df = 38$

At $\alpha = 0.05$ we reject the null hypthesis and conclude $\beta_1 \neq 0$ meaning that that $MRI$ is a signifigant variable

(f)

$MRI(1001121) = -116.844 + 0.000239(1001121) = 122.423919$

From SPSS $(1-\alpha)\times 100\%$ CI is $(110.40465, 134.93294)$
From SPSS $(1-\alpha)\times 100\%$ PI is $(79.09612, 166.24147)$

The prediction is much wider than the confidence interval

Given that the assumptions are satisfied from the previous questions PI should be used, if there were violations it would be better to use the CI
