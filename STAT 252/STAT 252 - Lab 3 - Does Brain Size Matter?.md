# Question 1

(a)

- The purpase of this study is as described in the abstract,  "to examine the relationship between brain size and intelligence for a random sample of university students."
- Response variables:
	- $PID$

- Explanatory variables:
	- $MRI$
	- $SEX$
	- $WEIGHT$


(b)

>The study was conducted at a large southwestern university in USA. Researchers randomly selected a sample of 40 students from a larger pool of right-handed Anglo introductory psychology students, who had indicated no history of alcoholism, unconsciousness, brain damage, epilepsy, or heart disease and had volunteered to participate in the study.  ... With prior approval of the University's research review board, students selected for MRI were required to obtain prorated full-scale IQs of greater than 130 or less than 103, and were equally divided by sex and IQ classification.

- The selection criteria were very specific so definining a population to generalize the results to would be very difficult and would proabaly not be very useful.

- I think that they chose people on the extreme ends of the IQ spectrum to more easily detect patterns, if they allowed people with more average IQ's they would have to deal with natrual variability affecting their results more.

(c)

- Causal inferences cannot be established as this study is observational not experimental

- Some factors that could effect IQ scores are:
	- Education
	- Genetics
	- External factors while taking test (Health, Hunger, Tiredness, etc.)
	- Adeptness at test taking

- Some methods for controling for these factors would be:
	- Random sampling and more samples
	- Larger candidate pool
	- Group participants by factors like education level to isolate the effects
