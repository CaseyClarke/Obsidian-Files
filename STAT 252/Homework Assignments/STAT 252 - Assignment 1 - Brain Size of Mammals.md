# Question 1.

- This study is a retrospective observational study, we cannot make population inferences as there is no random sampling and we also cannot make causal inferences in observational studies at all. The findings would be able to the general population of all mammals if there was random sampling.

# Question 2.

(a)
- 
  >![Figure 1](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeXaY9iO05TcHHuAuw6f8vA7fyJcGpJHmsN3zHcJL_P5IRVOqh8MPjeTGuPKQDlEbolobedPNL-pAlnjmE-cdGfq1LCuAWu2qaZpR0ywJvLRu_CWA4N7Oy9cEitUAA80QqI5C-P?key=_VwyLlKMddU95SYPlK_KuEQP)
- 
  The mean for the LARGE group is overall larger than that of the SMALL group however, The S. D. for the SMALL group is smaller than that of the LARGE group suggesting a tighter spread of values within the SMALL group compared to the LARGE group

- 
  The IQR (size of box) is notably smaller for the SMALL group compared to the LARGE group, this is the same conclusion we came to from looking at the descriptive statistics in part (a). The median for the LARGE group is also notably higher up (larger) than that of the SMALL group. They are both right-skewed as the median is closer to the bottom of the box and the upper whisker is longer than the bottom. The recommended mesure of central tendency for both of them is the median as it is less affected by skew and outliers because they are both skewed. There are no outliers as SPSS identifies none by the $1.5 \times IQR$ Rule

- Since the points on both plots stay roughly close to the line we can assume the data is roughly normal, it seems as if the lower values are less normal and more extreme though.

(d)

- The assumptions are as follows, 
	- Normality - We can assume normality as we have a large sample and from part (c)
	- Random sampling - We __do not__ have random sampling
	- Independence - We can assume the data is independent from the study design
	- Equal variances - We can assume equal variances as $\frac{max(S_1, S_2)}{min(S_1,S_2)} = \frac{61.691}{30.767} < 2$

# Question 3.

- The means and S.D. for both groups are closer together than in Q2 (a), this suggests that they both have a tight spread and similar central tendency. The LARGE group has a slightly wider spread than that of the SMALL group however.

(b)

- 
  > ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdlTo6Z-WQ8EhIYnjt0kvWzOoPO2w1M3On33SQXVnOy79ZaVRBWZMb2an-NWsAvwIsESzOBErzOzcfsgzKorX_JpT-hIs5E1S548SdZus2ewIXQjx7ow5HQsly4Q-wvjXUO-NfU9Q?key=_VwyLlKMddU95SYPlK_KuEQP)

- The medians are similar for both plots however, the LARGE group has slightly higher median than the SMALL group. The IQR of both plots are very similar but again the LARGE group's IQR is slightly larger, the same conclusion we came to in part (a). They are now both slightly left skewed although less skewed than before the log transformation.  The recommended mesure of central tendency is still the median as the distributions are still skewed. There are no outliers as SPSS identifies none by the $1.5 \times IQR$ Rule

(c)

- Both plots follow the line very closely so we can be very confidence of the assumption of normality, far more than the version before the log transform

(d)

- It seemed as if the log transformation "smoothed out" the data, the variances became smaller, the skewness was reduced, and the evidence of normality was more evident
