# Question 1

- This study is a retrospective observational study, we cannot make population inferences as there is no random sampling and we also cannot make causal inferences in observational studies at all. The findings would be able to be generalized to the population of interest (all mammals) if there was random sampling.

# Question 2

(a)

- The mean for the LARGE group is overall larger than that of the SMALL group however, The S. D. for the SMALL group is smaller than that of the LARGE group suggesting a tighter spread of values within the SMALL group compared to the LARGE group

- The IQR (size of box) is notably smaller for the SMALL group compared to the LARGE group, this is the same conclusion we came to from looking at the descriptive statistics in part (a). The median for the LARGE group is also notably higher up (larger) than that of the SMALL group. They are both right-skewed as the median is closer to the bottom of the box and the upper whisker is longer than the bottom. The recommended mesure of central tendency for both of them is the median as it is less affected by skew and outliers because they are both skewed. There are no outliers as SPSS identifies none by the $1.5 \times IQR$ Rule. Non-symmetrical box plots also suggest non-normality and

- Since the points on both plots __do not__ stay roughly close to the line we can assume the data __is not__ roughly normal.

(d)

- The assumptions are as follows, 
	- Normality - This is violated as shown in part (c) and (b)
	- Random sampling - We __do not__ have random sampling
	- Independence - We can assume the data is independent from the study design
	- Equal variances - We can assume equal variances as $\frac{max(S_1, S_2)}{min(S_1,S_2)} = \frac{61.691}{30.767} < 2$ and from the fact that the box plots have roughly equal spreads

# Question 3

Any logarithm/antilogarithm mentioned is assumed to be base $e$, as that is what was used in the Instructional video, $ln(x)$ and $e^x$ are used to denote the logarithm and antilogarithm respectively

(a)

- The means and S.D. for both groups are closer together than in Q2 (a), this suggests that they both have a tight spread and similar central tendency. The LARGE group has a slightly wider spread than that of the SMALL group however.

(b)

- 
  > ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdlTo6Z-WQ8EhIYnjt0kvWzOoPO2w1M3On33SQXVnOy79ZaVRBWZMb2an-NWsAvwIsESzOBErzOzcfsgzKorX_JpT-hIs5E1S548SdZus2ewIXQjx7ow5HQsly4Q-wvjXUO-NfU9Q?key=_VwyLlKMddU95SYPlK_KuEQP)

- The medians are similar for both plots however, the LARGE group has slightly higher median than the SMALL group. The IQR of both plots are very similar but again the LARGE group's IQR is slightly larger, the same conclusion we came to in part (a). They are now both slightly left skewed although less skewed than before the log transformation.  The recommended mesure of central tendency is still the median as the distributions are still skewed. There are no outliers as SPSS identifies none by the $1.5 \times IQR$ Rule

- Both plots follow the line very closely so we can be very confidence of the assumption of normality, far more than the version before the log transform

(d)

- It seemed as if the log transformation "smoothed out" the data, the variances became smaller, the skewness was reduced, and the data became more normal

# Question 4

(a)
- $ln(\mu_{L} - \mu_{S}) = 1.8370 - 1.5910 = 0.246$
- $\mu_{L} - \mu_{S} = e^{0.246} \approx 1.2789$

- From log rules we know that 
- $$e^{ln(\mu_{L} - \mu_{S})} = e^{ln(\frac{\mu_{L}}{\mu_{S}})} = \frac{\mu_{L}}{\mu_{S}}$$
- Therefore the antilogarithm of the difference is the ratio of the brain sizes, e.g. on average the LARGE group has $1.2789\times$ the brain size compared to those of the SMALL group

- $H_0 : ln(\mu_L  - \mu_S) = 0$
- $H_A : ln(\mu_L - \mu_S) \neq 0$
- $t = -1.247$
- $p = 0.216$
- The distribution under the null hypothesis is normal. 
- Given that the p-value is bigger than our significance level of $0.01$ we fail to reject the null hypothesis

(c)

- $CI_{99} = (e^{-0.76525}, e^{0.27334}) \approx (0.46522, 1.31435)$

- From part (a) we know that a difference log transformed can be thought of as a ratio which means to form a conclusion from the confidence interval we need to check if it contains $1$ as that would mean that both means are equal, since it does in fact contain $1$ we can conclude that with $95\%$ confidence there is no difference between the means. This is the same conclusion we came to in part (a)

- $H_0 : \text{ The relative brain weight is the same for all groups}$
- $H_A : \text{ The relative brain weight is } \underline{\text{not}} \text{ the same for all groups}$
- $p = 0.219$
- Given that the p-value is still bigger than $0.01$ we fail to reject the null hypothesis, the same as Q4.
