# Question 1

 (a)

- (i)

	- A one-way ANOVA test with 5 means is the most appropriate with the paramaters being $\mu_{A}, \mu_{B}, \mu_{C}, \mu_{D}, \mu_{E}$

- (ii)

	- $H_0: \mu_{A} = \mu_{B} = \mu_{C} = \mu_{D}  = \mu_{E}$
	- $H_A : \text{There are some differences in the means}$

- (iii)


- $n = 30 \text{ (Number of Observations) } \quad a = 5 \text{ (Number of groups) }$
