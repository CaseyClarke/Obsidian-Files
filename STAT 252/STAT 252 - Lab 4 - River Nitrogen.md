# Question 1

The study is an observational study looking at statistics about rivers and not controlling any variables. From that we know that population inferences can be made but casual inferences cannot be made. We cannot say for certain that human activites are the cause of NO3 levels but we can show that there is a correlation between the two, another difficulty is that the real relationship may not be linear and there may be other confounding variables that are not explored in the study

It seems as if 
- DEP and NPREC 
  DENSITY and NO3
  NPREC and Density

show a linear strong linear relationship and 
  - NO3 and NPREC
  - PREC and Density
  
show a linear moderate linear relationship


(b)

- NO3 vs.
	- DISCHARG - Non-linear relationship
	- RUNOFF - Non-linear relationship
	- AREA - Non-linear relationship
	- Density - Solid linear relationship
	- DEP - Very Roughly linear relationship
	- NPREC - Roughly linear relationship
	- PREC - Non-linear relationship


- DENSITY would be the one I would choose If i had to choose only one predictor variable as it is the closest to a linear realationship
- A linear model would not be appropriate as over half of them do not show a linear relationship in the slightest

For the pairs of variables that were already linear the transform did not really change all that much but for the other variables they are a lot closer to linear or are at least closer to being randomly scattered around the middle of the graph and not the bottom left as a lot of graphs were in the previous question
