# Question 1

The study is an observational study looking at statistics about rivers and not controlling any variables. From that we know that population inferences can be made but casual inferences cannot be made. We cannot say for certain that human activites are the cause of NO3 levels but we can show that there is a correlation between the two, another difficulty is that the real relationship may not be linear and there may be other confounding variables that are not explored in the study
