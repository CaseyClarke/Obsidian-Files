# Question 1

(a)

- The population of interest is high school math students, the subjects are grade 12 math students from a large high school. The factor is teaching strategies, the levels are as follows:
	- Group 1: C (control group, only lecture notes and discussion)
	- Group 2: H (control plus weekly homework assignments)
	- Group 3: Q (control plus weekly quizzes)
	- Group 4: T (control plus computer tutorials)
	- Group 5: HT (control plus weekly homework as well as computer tutorials)
	- Group 6: QT (control plus weekly quizzes well as computer tutorials)

(b)

- Since this is an experiment with random sampling and allocation we can make causal inferences but population inferences are not possible as the sample was only from one grade of math students not all of the grades in high school

# Question 2

- HT seems to be the best strategy and C seems to be the worst just based off of comparing the means.

- The standard deviations stay roughly in the range of $(7, 9.5)$ and the ratio of the largest vs. the smallest standard deviations is about $1.3626$ meaning that we can safely assume equal variablity is satisified

C: Skewed - slightly left
H: Symmetric but with an outlier
HT: Roughly Symmetric
Q: Roughly Symmetric
QT: Roughly Symmetric
T Skewed - slightly right

The centers are vastly different

There is a lot of variance in the spreads and centers of the boxplots and there is an outlier in the H group. Given that the groups are only slightly skewed at max and there is only one outlier we can assume that normaility is preserved

All of the plots seem roughly normal, the dots stay close to the trend line and it is roughly $45Â°$

If the assumption of normality was violated it would pose a signifigant problem as it it a requirement for the following statistical tests and would affect the results greatly

# Question 3

(a)

- $H_0: \mu_{C} = \mu_{H} = \mu_{Q} = \mu_{T} = \mu_{HT} = \mu_{QT}$
- $H_A : \text{There are some differences in the means}$
