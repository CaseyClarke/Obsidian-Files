Note: For some reason not all of the points were displaying at the same time so I included two images, the first half of the point and the last half of the points
### Question 2

### Question 3

v vs. t linest

### Question 4

linear p vs t 

### Question 5

i chose to place the points on the left side of the ball, this was chosen to counteract the effects of motion blur on the placement of my points, If I would have chosen the top or the bottom of the ball the mesurements would have been less precise since as the ball went faster it became more of a blur.

### Question 6

 - Higher framerate and quality video which would give us more points and more accurate placement of the points
