### Question 1
> ![[Pasted image 20250923150335.png]]

Figure 1: LoggerPro output with axes and points labeled, note for some reason not all of the points were displaying at the same time so I included two images, the first half of the points and the last half of the points
### Question 2

### Question 3

v vs. t 

$g = -10.90223076 \pm 0.1492690521$
$v_{0,y} = -0.07395318653 \pm 0.04847659308$

### Question 4

linear p vs t 

$g = -11.27390259 \pm 0.02279928704$
$y_0 = 1.82045686 \pm 0.001600732071$

### Question 5

i chose to place the points on the left side of the ball, this was chosen to counteract the effects of motion blur on the placement of my points, If I would have chosen the top or the bottom of the ball the measurements would have been less precise since as the ball went faster it became more of a blur.

### Question 6

 - Higher framerate and quality video which would give us more points and more accurate placement of the points
 - include some more things here
 -
