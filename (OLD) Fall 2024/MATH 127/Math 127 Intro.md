About half of the course is useful techniques (algorithms etc.)
The other half is "real math", more conceptual

# What is algebra? (Class Comments) (Architecture)
- Solving Equations
- Patterns in equations
- Why equations work

Algebra today is the study of structures and relationships between structures in math / sci
- Symmetries for example

# Our course is really an introduction to (abstract) Algebra with linear algebra as a special focus
- What is a number?
	- Class examples
		- Something that answers "how much" or "how many"
		- Quantified measure
- How do numbers (useful to linear algebra) behave?
	- Examples are Rational numbers $\frac m n \in \mathbb{Q}$
	- Operations on Rational Numbers
	- Addition:  
		- $x + y \in \mathbb{Q} \ where \ x, y \ \in \mathbb{Q}$
		- Commutative Property
			- $x+y=y+x \ for \ all \ x,y \in \mathbb{Q}$
		- Distributive Property
			- $x(y + z) = xy + xz \ for \ all \ x,y \in \mathbb{Q}$
	- Multiplication:  
		- $xy \in \mathbb{Q} \ where \ x, y \in \mathbb{Q}$
		-  Commutative Property
			- $x+y=y+x \ for \ all \ x,y \in \mathbb{Q}$
		- Distributive Property
			- $x(x + z) = xy + xz \ for \ all \ x,y \in \mathbb{Q}$
	- Subtraction: 
		- $x-y \neq y-x$
		- The idea is that subtraction is really $x-y = x + (-y)$
	- 0 is a number such that $0 + x = x$
		- Additive Property
	- 1 is a number such that $1x = x$ for all x
	- $-y$ is a number such that $-y + y = 0$
	- $x^{-1}$ is a a number such that $xx^{-1} = 1$ for all x $\neq 0$
	- Division:
		- Division is defined to be $x \div y = xx^{-1}$
	- Any set of this which satisfies these properties is a number system which we can do linear algebra

# Golden Rule of Algebra
- It doesn't matter what something looks like, what matters is how it behaves
