## Key Exam Concepts from Lecture 1
## Systems Concepts

**Types of Systems:**

- **Isolated system**: Exchanges neither matter nor energy with surroundings (example: the universe; solar system is approximately isolated)
- **Closed system**: Exchanges energy but not matter with surroundings (example: Earth - approximately closed, loses some light gases, gains some meteorite material)
- **Open system**: Exchanges both matter and energy with surroundings (examples: animals, ecosystems, atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, geosphere)

**System Components:**

- **Reservoirs**: Locations where material sits for a period of time in a cycle
- **Fluxes**: The rate at which material moves from one reservoir to another (measured in units per time, like cubic km/year)
- **Residence time**: Average time a molecule spends in each reservoir (calculated by dividing reservoir size by flux rate)

## The Four Major Earth Systems

The atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere - these exchange both matter and energy with each other

## Water Cycle (Hydrologic Cycle)

**Five Main Water Reservoirs (relative sizes matter, not exact numbers):**

1. Oceans - by far the largest (~1-2 billion cubic km)
2. Glaciers and ice - second largest (~25 million cubic km)
3. Groundwater - similar to ice (~23 million cubic km) - most uncertain measurement
4. Surface water (lakes and rivers) - much smaller (~200,000 cubic km)
5. Atmosphere - smallest (~13,000 cubic km)
6. Biosphere (living things) - very small (~1,000 cubic km)

**Key Processes:**

- **Evaporation**: Water moving from surface to atmosphere
- **Transpiration**: Water evaporating from plant leaves
- **Evapotranspiration**: Combined evaporation and transpiration from land
- **Precipitation**: Rain and snow falling from atmosphere

**Important Flux Concepts:**

- Total water entering atmosphere ≈ total water leaving atmosphere (~500,000 cubic km/year)
- More precipitation falls on land than evaporates from it
- The difference (~40,000 cubic km/year) returns to ocean via rivers and groundwater
- Residence time in atmosphere: 1-2 weeks
- Residence time in oceans: several thousand years

**Climate Change Impact:**

- Glacier reservoir is shrinking (more melting than snow accumulation)
- Ocean reservoir is growing (causing sea level rise)
- When reservoirs change size, fluxes in and out don't balance exactly

**Human Impact:**

- ~11% of total runoff is directly diverted by humans (~4,400 cubic km/year)
- Over 25% of land precipitation undergoes evapotranspiration from human-dominated landscapes

## Solar System Concepts

**Formation:**

- Solar system formed ~4.567 billion years ago (4,567 MA or 4.567 GA)
- Condensed from a nebula (cloud of gas and dust) by gravitational attraction
- Formed as a disk with the Sun in the middle

**Orbital Mechanics:**

- Objects orbit due to balance between inertia (Newton's first law) and gravitational force
- **Gravity**: Force inversely proportional to the square of distance
- Orbits are ellipses (not perfect circles)
- **Perihelion**: Point closest to the Sun in an orbit
- **Aphelion**: Point farthest from the Sun

**Kepler's Laws:**

- Planets orbit in ellipses with the Sun at one focus
- Planets sweep out equal areas in equal times (move faster when closer to Sun)
- **Kepler's Third Law**: Period squared is proportional to distance cubed (P² ∝ D³)
- Planets farther from Sun take longer to orbit

**Temperature and Composition:**

- Solar nebula was hottest in the middle, cooler toward edges
- Inner planets lost hydrogen and helium (too hot to retain light gases)
- Outer planets retained hydrogen and helium

**Key Objects:**

- Comets: Best samples of original solar nebula, contain ice and volatile materials
- **Astronomical Unit (AU)**: Distance from Earth to Sun (~200,000 km)

## General Concepts to Understand

- The difference between positive and negative feedbacks in Earth systems
- Earth's distance from Sun affects energy received, but Earth's axial tilt controls seasons more than distance
- Earth is currently closest to Sun in January, farthest in July
- When viewing solar system from above Earth's North Pole, objects orbit counterclockwise

# Key Exam Concepts from Lecture 2

Based on the learning outcomes mentioned at the beginning of the lecture, here are the main concepts you'll need to understand:

## Scientific Method Terminology

You need to differentiate between **hypotheses, theories, scientific laws, principles, and models**. A hypothesis is a testable idea about how observations are related. If it survives multiple tests and explains many phenomena, it becomes a theory. A theory that's highly trusted and can be expressed concisely (often mathematically) may be called a scientific law. A principle is a hypothesis that works most of the time but has well-understood exceptions.

Models are simplified versions of natural systems, either physical constructions or computer simulations. The example given was climate models that divide the atmosphere into cubes.

## Scientific Notation

You should understand exponential format for expressing very large and very small numbers (like 3.155 × 10⁷ seconds in a year). Also important is expressing uncertainty in measurements, such as 2,661 ± 2 MA (million years ago).

## Key Examples to Remember

**Newton's Laws vs Einstein's Relativity**: Newton's laws work well at normal speeds but needed modification by Einstein for objects moving near the speed of light. This shows how scientific theories evolve but aren't necessarily "wrong."

**Continental Drift vs Plate Tectonics**: Alfred Wegener proposed continental drift, but it was controversial because it required the ocean floor to be soft and squishy. Plate tectonics (1960s-70s) explained the same observations better by proposing rigid plates with movement along narrow boundaries.

**Principle of Stratigraphic Superposition**: In sedimentary rock layers, the order of deposition is from bottom to top. However, this principle has exceptions (like igneous intrusions), which is why it's called a principle rather than a law.

## Paradigms and Scientific Revolutions

A paradigm is a new theory combined with new ways of observing and thinking about the world. Thomas Kuhn popularized this term. Plate tectonics is a good example, developed partly due to military ocean floor mapping and nuclear test monitoring networks in the 1950s-60s.

## Earth Science Characteristics

Earth science differs from experimental sciences like physics and chemistry in several ways:

- Mostly based on field observations in natural environments that can't be controlled
- Deals with extreme lengths of time (Ka = thousands of years ago, MA = millions, GA = billions)
- Limited scope for experiments due to time scales involved

**Uniformitarianism vs Actualism**: James Hutton's original uniformitarianism (1795) was too strict, claiming nothing happened in the past that we can't observe today. The modern version, **actualism**, states that the natural laws operating today are the same as in the past, but conditions and environments can change. The key phrase is "the present is the key to the past."

## Earth Science Subdisciplines

While you don't need to memorize all of them, be aware that Earth science includes paleontology, geophysics, geochemistry, oceanography, atmospheric science, and many others.

# Key Exam Concepts from Lecture 3
## Systems

**Definition and Types:**

- Systems are portions of the universe separated for observing and understanding changes
- **Isolated systems**: Don't exchange matter or energy (example: universe as a whole; solar system is approximately isolated)
- **Closed systems**: Exchange energy but not matter (example: Earth - approximately closed, with minor exceptions like hydrogen/helium escaping and meteorite impacts)
- **Open systems**: Exchange both matter and energy (examples: individual animals, ecosystems, atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, geosphere)

**The Four Major Earth Systems:** Atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere - energy and matter pass between these systems

## The Water/Hydrologic Cycle

**Key Terms:**

- **Reservoirs**: Locations where material sits for a period of time
- **Fluxes**: Rates at which material moves from one reservoir to another (measured in cubic km/year)
- **Residence time**: Average time a water molecule spends in each reservoir (calculated by dividing reservoir size by flux rate)

**Major Water Reservoirs** (know relative sizes, not exact numbers):

- Oceans: largest (~1-2 billion cubic km)
- Glaciers/ice: second largest (~25 million cubic km)
- Groundwater: third largest (~23 million cubic km) - most uncertain measurement
- Surface water (lakes/rivers): much smaller (~200,000 cubic km)
- Atmosphere: smallest (~13,000 cubic km)
- Biosphere: ~1,000 cubic km

**Residence Times Examples:**

- Atmosphere: 1-2 weeks (shortest)
- Oceans: several thousand years (longest)

**Water Cycle Processes:**

- Evaporation from oceans: ~425,000 cubic km/year
- Evapotranspiration from land: ~70,000 cubic km/year (includes both evaporation and transpiration through plants)
- Total evaporation: ~500,000 cubic km/year
- Precipitation on oceans: ~390,000 cubic km/year
- Precipitation on land: ~110,000 cubic km/year
- Runoff to oceans: ~40,000 cubic km/year (the difference between precipitation on land and evapotranspiration)

**Key Understanding:**

- The atmosphere maintains constant water volume because input equals output
- More water falls on land than evaporates from it - the difference flows back to oceans through rivers and groundwater
- Humans divert about 11% of total runoff

**Climate Change Effects:**

- Glacier reservoir is shrinking (more melting than snow accumulation)
- Ocean reservoir is expanding (sea level rising)
- When reservoirs change size, fluxes in and out don't balance exactly

## Solar System

**Formation:**

- Formed ~4.567 billion years ago (4,567 MA or 4.567 GA)
- Condensed from a nebula (cloud of gas and dust) by gravitational attraction
- Sun formed from the largest clump; planets from smaller clumps

**Orbits and Laws:**

- Objects orbit due to balance between inertia (Newton's first law) and gravitational force
- Orbits are ellipses, not perfect circles
- **Perihelion**: closest point to the Sun
- **Aphelion**: farthest point from the Sun

**Kepler's Laws** (especially the third):

- Kepler's Third Law: P² ∝ D³ (period squared is proportional to distance cubed)
- Planets farther from the Sun take much longer to orbit
- The mass of the planet doesn't affect its orbital period at a given distance

**Temperature Effects:**

- Solar nebula was hottest in the middle, cooler toward the edges
- Inner planets lost hydrogen and helium (too hot)
- Outer planets retained hydrogen and helium

**Earth's Orbit:**

- Earth is closest to Sun in January (Northern Hemisphere winter)
- Seasons are controlled by Earth's axial tilt, not distance from Sun
- Distance variation has small but important climate effects
# Key Exam Concepts from Lecture 4
## Comets and Small Solar System Bodies

**Comets** have very long, eccentric (elliptical) orbits and contain volatile materials. They're some of the most primitive objects we can study from the early solar system.

**Terminology for small objects:**

- Asteroids: larger objects (though the size cutoff with meteoroids is vague)
- Meteoroids: smaller objects in space
- Meteors: objects burning up in Earth's atmosphere ("shooting stars")
- Meteorites: pieces that reach Earth's surface

**Types of meteorites:**

- Iron meteorites: made of metal (iron-nickel), thought to be remnants of broken-up planets
- Stony meteorites: made of silicate minerals
- Chondrites: contain chondrules (small glass beads from the protoplanetary disk), representing material never incorporated into planets

## The Planets

**Outer planets** (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune): mostly hydrogen and helium gas, much larger than inner planets. Jupiter likely has metallic hydrogen inside due to high pressure.

**Inner planets** (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) and the Moon share similar structure:

- Metallic core (mostly iron-nickel)
- Rocky mantle (silicon, oxygen, magnesium, iron)
- Variable crust (different for each body due to different rock cycles)

**Rock cycles differ:**

- Mars: similar to Earth, evidence of past water, sedimentary rocks, wind-blown sand
- Earth: active plate tectonics
- Venus: thick CO₂ atmosphere, extreme greenhouse effect, possibly one-plate tectonics
- Mercury and Moon: dominated by impact cratering, pulverized surfaces

**The Moon** is unusually large (over 1/4 of Earth's diameter), making Earth-Moon more like a double planet system.

## Earth's Orbit and Seasons

The **ecliptic** is the plane of the solar system where planets orbit and eclipses occur.

**Seasons** are caused by Earth's axial tilt of 23.5° relative to the orbital plane. When the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun (June), it experiences summer; when tilted away (December), it experiences winter.

**Key positions:**

- Solstices: maximum tilt toward/away from Sun (June and December)
- Equinoxes: Earth's axis perpendicular to Sun-Earth line (March and September)

## Milankovitch Cycles

Three long-term orbital variations affect Earth's climate over thousands of years:

1. **Obliquity (41,000 years):** Axial tilt varies from 21.5° to 24.5°. Greater tilt = more extreme seasons.
2. **Precession (23,000 years):** Earth's axis wobbles like a spinning top, changing when solstices/equinoxes occur relative to Earth's orbital position.
3. **Eccentricity (100,000 years):** Orbit shape varies from nearly circular (0.3% eccentric) to more elliptical (6% eccentric), likely due to Jupiter's gravity.

These cycles affect climate distribution and intensity but operate on timescales of tens of thousands of years—much slower than human-caused climate change (decades to centuries).

## Tides

The Moon's gravity creates two tidal bulges on Earth (exaggerated in models, but only ~1 meter high in reality).

**Why two bulges?** The side facing the Moon experiences stronger gravitational pull. The far side has weaker gravity but the same inertia, causing water to bulge away as Earth and Moon orbit their common center of gravity (barycenter).

**Tidal timing:** High tides occur every ~12 hours and 50 minutes (not exactly 12 hours because the Moon also orbits Earth).

**Spring vs. Neap tides:**

- Spring tides: Sun and Moon aligned (new/full moon) → highest highs and lowest lows, occur every ~2 weeks
- Neap tides: Sun and Moon at 90° (quarter moons) → less extreme tides, occur between spring tides

## The Sun and Electromagnetic Radiation

**The Sun** is an average main sequence star:

- Radius: ~700,000 km (over 100× Earth's radius)
- Mass: 10³⁰ kg (300,000× Earth's mass)
- Power output: 3.8 × 10²⁶ watts
- Energy source: nuclear fusion

**Electromagnetic spectrum** (shortest to longest wavelength): Gamma rays → X-rays → Ultraviolet → Visible light (violet to red) → Infrared → Microwaves → Radio waves

The Sun emits most energy in the **visible light** range. Earth's atmosphere blocks harmful UV, X-rays, and gamma rays.

**Sunspot cycle:** 11-year cycle with minor variations in solar output (~0.1%). The Maunder Minimum (1650-1700) had few sunspots and coincided with colder climate.

## Energy Flow

**Energy reaching Earth:** ~174,000-175,000 terawatts (1.74 × 10¹⁷ watts) at the top of the atmosphere.

**Energy concentration varies by:**

- Latitude: concentrated at equator, spread out at poles
- Season: due to axial tilt
- Atmospheric absorption: water vapor, CO₂, oxygen, ozone, methane absorb different wavelengths

**Energy at surface:** ~1 kilowatt per square meter at the equator when Sun is directly overhead.

## Energy Units

- Joule: fundamental unit of energy
- Watt: power (1 joule/second)
- Kilowatt: 1,000 watts (appliances)
- Megawatt: 1 million watts (power stations)
- Gigawatt: 1 billion watts (countries)
- Terawatt: 1 trillion watts (whole Earth)
- Kilowatt-hour: 3.6 megajoules (electricity billing)
  
  
# Lecture 5

## **Energy and Global Systems**

**Energy Units:**

- **Joule** = SI unit of energy
- **Watt** = 1 joule per second
- **Terawatt (TW)** = 10¹² watts (used for global energy systems)

**Earth's Energy Budget:**

- Solar input: **174,000 TW**

- **30% of solar energy reflected** back to space (Earth's albedo)
- Photosynthesis captures: 40 TW
- Human energy use: 15-20 TW
- **Critical point**: Humans extract fossil fuels ~80× faster than they're being created

## **Temperature vs. Heat** (Important Distinction!)

- **Temperature** = average kinetic energy of molecules (**intensive** variable)
    - Doesn't change if you double the amount of substance
- **Heat** = total kinetic energy of all molecules (**extensive** variable)
    - Doubles if you double the amount of substance

---

## **Atmospheric Pressure**

- **Definition**: Force per unit area exerted by gas molecules
- **Units**: Kilopascals (kPa)
- **Sea level pressure**: ~101 kPa (or 1 atmosphere)
- **Pressure decreases with altitude** (halves by 5 km up)
- **Isobars** = lines of constant pressure on weather maps
- Air flows from **high → low pressure**

---

## **Adiabatic Processes** (Key for Understanding Weather!)

When air rises:

- It **expands** (lower external pressure)
- **Does work** against surrounding air
- **Cools down** without heat transfer
- **Adiabatic lapse rate**: ~10°C per kilometer

This explains why:

- Mountaintops are cold
- Airplanes fly through freezing air at high altitude

---

## **Atmospheric Layers** (Bottom to Top)

### 1. **Troposphere** (0-10/15 km)

- Where **all weather** occurs
- Temperature **decreases** with altitude
- Contains most atmospheric mass
- Thicker at equator (~18 km) than poles (~10 km)
- Top boundary = **tropopause**

### 2. **Stratosphere** (10/15-50 km)

- Temperature **increases** with altitude
- Contains **ozone layer** (~50 km up)
- Ozone absorbs UV radiation → warms this layer
- Top boundary = **stratopause**

### 3. **Mesosphere** (50-80/90 km)

- Temperature **decreases** with altitude
- Coldest part of atmosphere
- Top boundary = **mesopause**

### 4. **Thermosphere** (>90 km)

- Temperature **increases** with altitude
- **High temperature, LOW heat** (few molecules)
- Contains **ionosphere** (aurora borealis/australis occur here)

---

## **Atmospheric Composition**

**Major Gases (dry air):**

- **Nitrogen (N₂)**: ~78-79%
- **Oxygen (O₂)**: ~21%
- **Argon (Ar)**: ~1%
- **Water vapor (H₂O)**: 0-4% (highly variable)

**Trace Gases** (small amounts, big importance):

- **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)**: ~0.04% (increasing annually)
- **Ozone (O₃)**: Parts per million, absorbs UV
- **Methane (CH₄)**

**Aerosols** = suspended particles:

- Water droplets (clouds)
- Dust
- Pollen
- Salt from oceans
- Soot from fires

---

## **Important Cycles**

**Carbon Cycle:**

- **Photosynthesis**: CO₂ → stored carbon + O₂ (energy storage)
- **Respiration**: Carbon + O₂ → CO₂ + energy (energy release)

**Nitrogen Cycle:**

- **Nitrogen fixation**: N₂ → usable forms
    - Lightning (creates nitrates)
    - Nitrogen-fixing bacteria in plant roots (creates ammonium)
- Essential for proteins in living things

---

## **Weather vs. Climate**

- **Weather** = short-term changes (seconds to weeks)
    - Studied by meteorologists
- **Climate** = averaged weather over long periods
    - Typically 30 years for averaging
    - 3-5 years for studying climate change
    - Studied by climatologists

# Lecture 6

## **. Water Vapor in the Atmosphere**

- **Saturation vapor pressure**: The maximum amount of water vapor air can hold in equilibrium with liquid water at a given temperature
- Increases with temperature (warm air can hold more water than cold air)
- **Relative humidity**: The actual water vapor content compared to saturation level (expressed as %)
- **Dew point**: The temperature at which air becomes saturated if cooled

## **2. Greenhouse Gases**

**Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):**

- Pre-industrial: ~280 ppm
- Current: 425+ ppm (and rising)
- Seasonal "sawtooth" pattern due to Northern Hemisphere forests absorbing CO₂ in summer, releasing it in winter
- Monitored at Mauna Loa, Hawaii
- Transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation

**Methane (CH₄):**

- Current: 1.9 ppm (vs. 0.7 ppm pre-industrial)
- Powerful greenhouse gas but shorter atmospheric residence time than CO₂
- Sources: natural gas leaks, decomposition, livestock digestion

## **3. Water Phase Changes**

**Key Properties:**

- Water exists in 3 phases: solid (ice), liquid, vapor
- **Unusual property**: Ice is less dense than liquid water (why ice floats)
- Phase diagram shows stability fields at different temperatures and pressures

**Latent Energy:**

- Energy absorbed during: melting, evaporation, sublimation
- Energy released during: freezing, condensation
- This creates **negative feedbacks** in the climate system

## **4. Cloud Formation & Precipitation**

**Process:**

1. Air becomes saturated (reaches 100% relative humidity)
2. Air becomes supersaturated (cooling below dew point)
3. Nucleation occurs (water droplets form - requires extra energy)
4. Droplets grow to ~20 microns
5. Droplets collide and merge
6. Large droplets fall as rain (or snow if below freezing)

## **5. Adiabatic Lapse Rates** ⭐ _Remember these numbers_

- **Dry adiabatic lapse rate**: 10°C per kilometer
    - Air cools as it rises and expands
- **Wet adiabatic lapse rate**: 6°C per kilometer
    - Slower cooling in clouds due to latent heat release from condensation

## **6. Atmospheric Circulation**

**Heat Transfer:**

- More solar energy enters at equator than poles
- Heat energy is transferred poleward by atmosphere and oceans

**Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ):**

- Low pressure zone at the equator
- Warm air rises, creating clouds
- Visible as a band of clouds along the equator

**Coriolis Effect:**

- Deflects moving air to the right in Northern Hemisphere
- Deflects moving air to the left in Southern Hemisphere
- Caused by Earth's rotation
- Prevents air from flowing directly from equator to poles

**Geostrophic Wind:**

- Wind flows nearly parallel to isobars (lines of equal pressure)
- Balance between pressure gradient force and Coriolis deflection
- At surface: wind flows diagonally across isobars (due to friction)
