## Key Exam Concepts from Lecture 1
## Systems Concepts

**Types of Systems:**

- **Isolated system**: Exchanges neither matter nor energy with surroundings (example: the universe; solar system is approximately isolated)
- **Closed system**: Exchanges energy but not matter with surroundings (example: Earth - approximately closed, loses some light gases, gains some meteorite material)
- **Open system**: Exchanges both matter and energy with surroundings (examples: animals, ecosystems, atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, geosphere)

**System Components:**

- **Reservoirs**: Locations where material sits for a period of time in a cycle
- **Fluxes**: The rate at which material moves from one reservoir to another (measured in units per time, like cubic km/year)
- **Residence time**: Average time a molecule spends in each reservoir (calculated by dividing reservoir size by flux rate)

## The Four Major Earth Systems

The atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere - these exchange both matter and energy with each other

## Water Cycle (Hydrologic Cycle)

**Five Main Water Reservoirs (relative sizes matter, not exact numbers):**

1. Oceans - by far the largest (~1-2 billion cubic km)
2. Glaciers and ice - second largest (~25 million cubic km)
3. Groundwater - similar to ice (~23 million cubic km) - most uncertain measurement
4. Surface water (lakes and rivers) - much smaller (~200,000 cubic km)
5. Atmosphere - smallest (~13,000 cubic km)
6. Biosphere (living things) - very small (~1,000 cubic km)

**Key Processes:**

- **Evaporation**: Water moving from surface to atmosphere
- **Transpiration**: Water evaporating from plant leaves
- **Evapotranspiration**: Combined evaporation and transpiration from land
- **Precipitation**: Rain and snow falling from atmosphere

**Important Flux Concepts:**

- Total water entering atmosphere ≈ total water leaving atmosphere (~500,000 cubic km/year)
- More precipitation falls on land than evaporates from it
- The difference (~40,000 cubic km/year) returns to ocean via rivers and groundwater
- Residence time in atmosphere: 1-2 weeks
- Residence time in oceans: several thousand years

**Climate Change Impact:**

- Glacier reservoir is shrinking (more melting than snow accumulation)
- Ocean reservoir is growing (causing sea level rise)
- When reservoirs change size, fluxes in and out don't balance exactly

**Human Impact:**

- ~11% of total runoff is directly diverted by humans (~4,400 cubic km/year)
- Over 25% of land precipitation undergoes evapotranspiration from human-dominated landscapes

## Solar System Concepts

**Formation:**

- Solar system formed ~4.567 billion years ago (4,567 MA or 4.567 GA)
- Condensed from a nebula (cloud of gas and dust) by gravitational attraction
- Formed as a disk with the Sun in the middle

**Orbital Mechanics:**

- Objects orbit due to balance between inertia (Newton's first law) and gravitational force
- **Gravity**: Force inversely proportional to the square of distance
- Orbits are ellipses (not perfect circles)
- **Perihelion**: Point closest to the Sun in an orbit
- **Aphelion**: Point farthest from the Sun

**Kepler's Laws:**

- Planets orbit in ellipses with the Sun at one focus
- Planets sweep out equal areas in equal times (move faster when closer to Sun)
- **Kepler's Third Law**: Period squared is proportional to distance cubed (P² ∝ D³)
- Planets farther from Sun take longer to orbit

**Temperature and Composition:**

- Solar nebula was hottest in the middle, cooler toward edges
- Inner planets lost hydrogen and helium (too hot to retain light gases)
- Outer planets retained hydrogen and helium

**Key Objects:**

- Comets: Best samples of original solar nebula, contain ice and volatile materials
- **Astronomical Unit (AU)**: Distance from Earth to Sun (~200,000 km)

## General Concepts to Understand

- The difference between positive and negative feedbacks in Earth systems
- Earth's distance from Sun affects energy received, but Earth's axial tilt controls seasons more than distance
- Earth is currently closest to Sun in January, farthest in July
- When viewing solar system from above Earth's North Pole, objects orbit counterclockwise

# Key Exam Concepts from Lecture 2

Based on the learning outcomes mentioned at the beginning of the lecture, here are the main concepts you'll need to understand:

## Scientific Method Terminology

You need to differentiate between **hypotheses, theories, scientific laws, principles, and models**. A hypothesis is a testable idea about how observations are related. If it survives multiple tests and explains many phenomena, it becomes a theory. A theory that's highly trusted and can be expressed concisely (often mathematically) may be called a scientific law. A principle is a hypothesis that works most of the time but has well-understood exceptions.

Models are simplified versions of natural systems, either physical constructions or computer simulations. The example given was climate models that divide the atmosphere into cubes.

## Scientific Notation

You should understand exponential format for expressing very large and very small numbers (like 3.155 × 10⁷ seconds in a year). Also important is expressing uncertainty in measurements, such as 2,661 ± 2 MA (million years ago).

## Key Examples to Remember

**Newton's Laws vs Einstein's Relativity**: Newton's laws work well at normal speeds but needed modification by Einstein for objects moving near the speed of light. This shows how scientific theories evolve but aren't necessarily "wrong."

**Continental Drift vs Plate Tectonics**: Alfred Wegener proposed continental drift, but it was controversial because it required the ocean floor to be soft and squishy. Plate tectonics (1960s-70s) explained the same observations better by proposing rigid plates with movement along narrow boundaries.

**Principle of Stratigraphic Superposition**: In sedimentary rock layers, the order of deposition is from bottom to top. However, this principle has exceptions (like igneous intrusions), which is why it's called a principle rather than a law.

## Paradigms and Scientific Revolutions

A paradigm is a new theory combined with new ways of observing and thinking about the world. Thomas Kuhn popularized this term. Plate tectonics is a good example, developed partly due to military ocean floor mapping and nuclear test monitoring networks in the 1950s-60s.

## Earth Science Characteristics

Earth science differs from experimental sciences like physics and chemistry in several ways:

- Mostly based on field observations in natural environments that can't be controlled
- Deals with extreme lengths of time (Ka = thousands of years ago, MA = millions, GA = billions)
- Limited scope for experiments due to time scales involved

**Uniformitarianism vs Actualism**: James Hutton's original uniformitarianism (1795) was too strict, claiming nothing happened in the past that we can't observe today. The modern version, **actualism**, states that the natural laws operating today are the same as in the past, but conditions and environments can change. The key phrase is "the present is the key to the past."

## Earth Science Subdisciplines

While you don't need to memorize all of them, be aware that Earth science includes paleontology, geophysics, geochemistry, oceanography, atmospheric science, and many others.

# Key Exam Concepts from Lecture 3
## Systems

**Definition and Types:**

- Systems are portions of the universe separated for observing and understanding changes
- **Isolated systems**: Don't exchange matter or energy (example: universe as a whole; solar system is approximately isolated)
- **Closed systems**: Exchange energy but not matter (example: Earth - approximately closed, with minor exceptions like hydrogen/helium escaping and meteorite impacts)
- **Open systems**: Exchange both matter and energy (examples: individual animals, ecosystems, atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, geosphere)

**The Four Major Earth Systems:** Atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere - energy and matter pass between these systems

## The Water/Hydrologic Cycle

**Key Terms:**

- **Reservoirs**: Locations where material sits for a period of time
- **Fluxes**: Rates at which material moves from one reservoir to another (measured in cubic km/year)
- **Residence time**: Average time a water molecule spends in each reservoir (calculated by dividing reservoir size by flux rate)

**Major Water Reservoirs** (know relative sizes, not exact numbers):

- Oceans: largest (~1-2 billion cubic km)
- Glaciers/ice: second largest (~25 million cubic km)
- Groundwater: third largest (~23 million cubic km) - most uncertain measurement
- Surface water (lakes/rivers): much smaller (~200,000 cubic km)
- Atmosphere: smallest (~13,000 cubic km)
- Biosphere: ~1,000 cubic km

**Residence Times Examples:**

- Atmosphere: 1-2 weeks (shortest)
- Oceans: several thousand years (longest)

**Water Cycle Processes:**

- Evaporation from oceans: ~425,000 cubic km/year
- Evapotranspiration from land: ~70,000 cubic km/year (includes both evaporation and transpiration through plants)
- Total evaporation: ~500,000 cubic km/year
- Precipitation on oceans: ~390,000 cubic km/year
- Precipitation on land: ~110,000 cubic km/year
- Runoff to oceans: ~40,000 cubic km/year (the difference between precipitation on land and evapotranspiration)

**Key Understanding:**

- The atmosphere maintains constant water volume because input equals output
- More water falls on land than evaporates from it - the difference flows back to oceans through rivers and groundwater
- Humans divert about 11% of total runoff

**Climate Change Effects:**

- Glacier reservoir is shrinking (more melting than snow accumulation)
- Ocean reservoir is expanding (sea level rising)
- When reservoirs change size, fluxes in and out don't balance exactly

## Solar System

**Formation:**

- Formed ~4.567 billion years ago (4,567 MA or 4.567 GA)
- Condensed from a nebula (cloud of gas and dust) by gravitational attraction
- Sun formed from the largest clump; planets from smaller clumps

**Orbits and Laws:**

- Objects orbit due to balance between inertia (Newton's first law) and gravitational force
- Orbits are ellipses, not perfect circles
- **Perihelion**: closest point to the Sun
- **Aphelion**: farthest point from the Sun

**Kepler's Laws** (especially the third):

- Kepler's Third Law: P² ∝ D³ (period squared is proportional to distance cubed)
- Planets farther from the Sun take much longer to orbit
- The mass of the planet doesn't affect its orbital period at a given distance

**Temperature Effects:**

- Solar nebula was hottest in the middle, cooler toward the edges
- Inner planets lost hydrogen and helium (too hot)
- Outer planets retained hydrogen and helium

**Earth's Orbit:**

- Earth is closest to Sun in January (Northern Hemisphere winter)
- Seasons are controlled by Earth's axial tilt, not distance from Sun
- Distance variation has small but important climate effects
# Key Exam Concepts from Lecture 4
## Comets and Small Solar System Bodies

**Comets** have very long, eccentric (elliptical) orbits and contain volatile materials. They're some of the most primitive objects we can study from the early solar system.

**Terminology for small objects:**

- Asteroids: larger objects (though the size cutoff with meteoroids is vague)
- Meteoroids: smaller objects in space
- Meteors: objects burning up in Earth's atmosphere ("shooting stars")
- Meteorites: pieces that reach Earth's surface

**Types of meteorites:**

- Iron meteorites: made of metal (iron-nickel), thought to be remnants of broken-up planets
- Stony meteorites: made of silicate minerals
- Chondrites: contain chondrules (small glass beads from the protoplanetary disk), representing material never incorporated into planets

## The Planets

**Outer planets** (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune): mostly hydrogen and helium gas, much larger than inner planets. Jupiter likely has metallic hydrogen inside due to high pressure.

**Inner planets** (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) and the Moon share similar structure:

- Metallic core (mostly iron-nickel)
- Rocky mantle (silicon, oxygen, magnesium, iron)
- Variable crust (different for each body due to different rock cycles)

**Rock cycles differ:**

- Mars: similar to Earth, evidence of past water, sedimentary rocks, wind-blown sand
- Earth: active plate tectonics
- Venus: thick CO₂ atmosphere, extreme greenhouse effect, possibly one-plate tectonics
- Mercury and Moon: dominated by impact cratering, pulverized surfaces

**The Moon** is unusually large (over 1/4 of Earth's diameter), making Earth-Moon more like a double planet system.

## Earth's Orbit and Seasons

The **ecliptic** is the plane of the solar system where planets orbit and eclipses occur.

**Seasons** are caused by Earth's axial tilt of 23.5° relative to the orbital plane. When the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun (June), it experiences summer; when tilted away (December), it experiences winter.

**Key positions:**

- Solstices: maximum tilt toward/away from Sun (June and December)
- Equinoxes: Earth's axis perpendicular to Sun-Earth line (March and September)

## Milankovitch Cycles

Three long-term orbital variations affect Earth's climate over thousands of years:

1. **Obliquity (41,000 years):** Axial tilt varies from 21.5° to 24.5°. Greater tilt = more extreme seasons.
2. **Precession (23,000 years):** Earth's axis wobbles like a spinning top, changing when solstices/equinoxes occur relative to Earth's orbital position.
3. **Eccentricity (100,000 years):** Orbit shape varies from nearly circular (0.3% eccentric) to more elliptical (6% eccentric), likely due to Jupiter's gravity.

These cycles affect climate distribution and intensity but operate on timescales of tens of thousands of years—much slower than human-caused climate change (decades to centuries).

## Tides

The Moon's gravity creates two tidal bulges on Earth (exaggerated in models, but only ~1 meter high in reality).

**Why two bulges?** The side facing the Moon experiences stronger gravitational pull. The far side has weaker gravity but the same inertia, causing water to bulge away as Earth and Moon orbit their common center of gravity (barycenter).

**Tidal timing:** High tides occur every ~12 hours and 50 minutes (not exactly 12 hours because the Moon also orbits Earth).

**Spring vs. Neap tides:**

- Spring tides: Sun and Moon aligned (new/full moon) → highest highs and lowest lows, occur every ~2 weeks
- Neap tides: Sun and Moon at 90° (quarter moons) → less extreme tides, occur between spring tides

## The Sun and Electromagnetic Radiation

**The Sun** is an average main sequence star:

- Radius: ~700,000 km (over 100× Earth's radius)
- Mass: 10³⁰ kg (300,000× Earth's mass)
- Power output: 3.8 × 10²⁶ watts
- Energy source: nuclear fusion

**Electromagnetic spectrum** (shortest to longest wavelength): Gamma rays → X-rays → Ultraviolet → Visible light (violet to red) → Infrared → Microwaves → Radio waves

The Sun emits most energy in the **visible light** range. Earth's atmosphere blocks harmful UV, X-rays, and gamma rays.

**Sunspot cycle:** 11-year cycle with minor variations in solar output (~0.1%). The Maunder Minimum (1650-1700) had few sunspots and coincided with colder climate.

## Energy Flow

**Energy reaching Earth:** ~174,000-175,000 terawatts (1.74 × 10¹⁷ watts) at the top of the atmosphere.

**Energy concentration varies by:**

- Latitude: concentrated at equator, spread out at poles
- Season: due to axial tilt
- Atmospheric absorption: water vapor, CO₂, oxygen, ozone, methane absorb different wavelengths

**Energy at surface:** ~1 kilowatt per square meter at the equator when Sun is directly overhead.

## Energy Units

- Joule: fundamental unit of energy
- Watt: power (1 joule/second)
- Kilowatt: 1,000 watts (appliances)
- Megawatt: 1 million watts (power stations)
- Gigawatt: 1 billion watts (countries)
- Terawatt: 1 trillion watts (whole Earth)
- Kilowatt-hour: 3.6 megajoules (electricity billing)
  
  
# Lecture 5

**Energy Units:**

- **Joule** = SI unit of energy
- **Watt** = 1 joule per second
- **Terawatt (TW)** = 10¹² watts (used for global energy systems)

**Earth's Energy Budget:**

- Human energy use: 15-20 TW
- **Critical point**: Humans extract fossil fuels ~80× faster than they're being created

---

## **Temperature vs. Heat** (Important Distinction!)

- **Temperature** = average kinetic energy of molecules (**intensive** variable)
    - Doesn't change if you double the amount of substance
- **Heat** = total kinetic energy of all molecules (**extensive** variable)
    - Doubles if you double the amount of substance

---

## **Atmospheric Pressure**

- **Definition**: Force per unit area exerted by gas molecules
- **Units**: Kilopascals (kPa)
- **Sea level pressure**: ~101 kPa (or 1 atmosphere)
- **Pressure decreases with altitude** (halves by 5 km up)
- **Isobars** = lines of constant pressure on weather maps
- Air flows from **high → low pressure**

---

## **Adiabatic Processes** (Key for Understanding Weather!)

When air rises:

- It **expands** (lower external pressure)
- **Does work** against surrounding air
- **Cools down** without heat transfer
- **Adiabatic lapse rate**: ~10°C per kilometer

This explains why:

- Mountaintops are cold
- Airplanes fly through freezing air at high altitude

---

## **Atmospheric Layers** (Bottom to Top)

### 1. **Troposphere** (0-10/15 km)

- Where **all weather** occurs
- Temperature **decreases** with altitude
- Contains most atmospheric mass
- Thicker at equator (~18 km) than poles (~10 km)
- Top boundary = **tropopause**

### 2. **Stratosphere** (10/15-50 km)

- Temperature **increases** with altitude
- Contains **ozone layer** (~50 km up)
- Ozone absorbs UV radiation → warms this layer
- Top boundary = **stratopause**

### 3. **Mesosphere** (50-80/90 km)

- Temperature **decreases** with altitude
- Coldest part of atmosphere
- Top boundary = **mesopause**

### 4. **Thermosphere** (>90 km)

- Temperature **increases** with altitude
- **High temperature, LOW heat** (few molecules)
- Contains **ionosphere** (aurora borealis/australis occur here)

---

## **Atmospheric Composition**

**Major Gases (dry air):**

- **Nitrogen (N₂)**: ~78-79%
- **Oxygen (O₂)**: ~21%
- **Argon (Ar)**: ~1%
- **Water vapor (H₂O)**: 0-4% (highly variable)

**Trace Gases** (small amounts, big importance):

- **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)**: ~0.04% (increasing annually)
- **Ozone (O₃)**: Parts per million, absorbs UV
- **Methane (CH₄)**

**Aerosols** = suspended particles:

- Water droplets (clouds)
- Dust
- Pollen
- Salt from oceans
- Soot from fires

---

## **Important Cycles**

**Carbon Cycle:**

- **Photosynthesis**: CO₂ → stored carbon + O₂ (energy storage)
- **Respiration**: Carbon + O₂ → CO₂ + energy (energy release)

**Nitrogen Cycle:**

- **Nitrogen fixation**: N₂ → usable forms
    - Lightning (creates nitrates)
    - Nitrogen-fixing bacteria in plant roots (creates ammonium)
- Essential for proteins in living things

---

## **Weather vs. Climate**

- **Weather** = short-term changes (seconds to weeks)
    - Studied by meteorologists
- **Climate** = averaged weather over long periods
    - Typically 30 years for averaging
    - 3-5 years for studying climate change
    - Studied by climatologists

# Lecture 6

## **. Water Vapor in the Atmosphere**

- **Saturation vapor pressure**: The maximum amount of water vapor air can hold in equilibrium with liquid water at a given temperature
- Increases with temperature (warm air can hold more water than cold air)
- **Relative humidity**: The actual water vapor content compared to saturation level (expressed as %)
- **Dew point**: The temperature at which air becomes saturated if cooled

## **2. Greenhouse Gases**

**Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):**

- Pre-industrial: ~280 ppm
- Current: 425+ ppm (and rising)
- Seasonal "sawtooth" pattern due to Northern Hemisphere forests absorbing CO₂ in summer, releasing it in winter
- Monitored at Mauna Loa, Hawaii
- Transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation

**Methane (CH₄):**

- Current: 1.9 ppm (vs. 0.7 ppm pre-industrial)
- Powerful greenhouse gas but shorter atmospheric residence time than CO₂
- Sources: natural gas leaks, decomposition, livestock digestion

## **3. Water Phase Changes**

**Key Properties:**

- Water exists in 3 phases: solid (ice), liquid, vapor
- **Unusual property**: Ice is less dense than liquid water (why ice floats)
- Phase diagram shows stability fields at different temperatures and pressures

**Latent Energy:**

- Energy absorbed during: melting, evaporation, sublimation
- Energy released during: freezing, condensation
- This creates **negative feedbacks** in the climate system

## **4. Cloud Formation & Precipitation**

**Process:**

1. Air becomes saturated (reaches 100% relative humidity)
2. Air becomes supersaturated (cooling below dew point)
3. Nucleation occurs (water droplets form - requires extra energy)
4. Droplets grow to ~20 microns
5. Droplets collide and merge
6. Large droplets fall as rain (or snow if below freezing)

## **5. Adiabatic Lapse Rates** ⭐ _Remember these numbers_

- **Dry adiabatic lapse rate**: 10°C per kilometer
    - Air cools as it rises and expands
- **Wet adiabatic lapse rate**: 6°C per kilometer
    - Slower cooling in clouds due to latent heat release from condensation

## **6. Atmospheric Circulation**

**Heat Transfer:**

- More solar energy enters at equator than poles
- Heat energy is transferred poleward by atmosphere and oceans

**Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ):**

- Low pressure zone at the equator
- Warm air rises, creating clouds
- Visible as a band of clouds along the equator

**Coriolis Effect:**

- Deflects moving air to the right in Northern Hemisphere
- Deflects moving air to the left in Southern Hemisphere
- Caused by Earth's rotation
- Prevents air from flowing directly from equator to poles

**Geostrophic Wind:**

- Wind flows nearly parallel to isobars (lines of equal pressure)
- Balance between pressure gradient force and Coriolis deflection
- At surface: wind flows diagonally across isobars (due to friction)
# Lecture 7

## **Key Content to Study**

### **1. Coriolis Effect**

- Causes moving objects to appear to curve on rotating Earth
- Affects large-scale weather (NOT toilets - that's a myth!)
- Opposite effects in Northern vs Southern hemispheres

### **2. Pressure Systems**

- **High Pressure (Anticyclones):** descending air, clear/dry weather, winds spiral outward
    - NH: clockwise / SH: counterclockwise
- **Low Pressure (Cyclones):** rising air, clouds/rain, winds spiral inward
    - NH: counterclockwise / SH: clockwise

### **3. Atmospheric Circulation Cells**

- **Hadley Cell:** rises at ITCZ → descends at Horse Latitudes (~30°)
- **Ferrel Cell:** mid-latitudes, opposite rotation to Hadley
- **Polar Cell:** rises at ~60° → descends at poles
- **Polar Front:** ~60° latitude, creates waves; **jet stream** runs along it

### **4. Fronts**

- **Warm front:** warm air over cold → gradual clouds/rain
- **Cold front:** cold air under warm → steeper, more intense weather
- Both push warm air upward → condensation

### **5. Local Winds**

- **Sea/Land Breeze:** day (sea→land), night (land→sea)
- **Mountain Winds:** anabatic (upslope), catabatic (downslope)
- **Chinook:** warm, dry wind descending mountains (Calgary)

### **6. Sediment & Wind Erosion**

- **Sizes:** dust (<1/16mm), sand (1/16-2mm), gravel (>2mm)
- Wind-deposited sediment = well-sorted, rounded → good aquifers

### **7. Cloud Formation**

- **How:** moist air cools below dew point
- **4 Lifting Mechanisms:** density, frontal, orographic, convergence

### **8. Cloud Types** ⭐ (May appear on exam)

**3 Basic Types:**

- **Cumulus:** fluffy, flat bottom, rising air
- **Stratus:** horizontal layers
- **Cirrus:** wispy ice clouds (>6km altitude)

**7 Variants:**

- **Cumulonimbus:** tall cumulus with rain, thunder/lightning
- **Stratocumulus:** low, spread-out + lumpy
- **Altocumulus:** mid-level (2-6km), clumpy
- **Cirrocumulus:** high ice cumulus
- **Nimbostratus:** layered with steady rain
- **Altostratus:** high stratus (can see sun through)
- **Cirrostratus:** ice stratus, may be wavy

# Lecture 8

## **Severe Weather Phenomena**

**Thunderstorms:**

- Form in warm, moist air, especially along cold fronts where maritime tropical (warm/moist) meets continental polar (cold/dry) air
- Upward air motion causes rapid cooling and condensation, releasing latent energy
- **Lightning**: caused by ionization of air molecules; cloud top becomes positively charged, base negatively charged
- **Hail**: ice particles carried upward, enlarged by freezing supercooled water
- **Thunder**: sound from lightning; travels ~3 seconds per kilometer (count seconds between flash and thunder, divide by 3 for distance in km)

**Tornadoes:**

- Form in spiral updrafts within thunderstorms
- Funnel cloud → becomes tornado when it touches ground
- Tightly rotating low-pressure centers
- Don't always rotate cyclonically (Coriolis effect is weak at small scales)
- Maximum winds: 480 km/h; extreme low pressure
- Myth debunked: Don't open windows during tornado approach

**Tropical Cyclones:**

- Form just outside the ITCZ (need Coriolis effect to rotate)
- Require warm water (>26°C) and moist air
- **Names vary by region**: Hurricanes (Atlantic), Typhoons (West Pacific), Tropical Cyclones (elsewhere)
- **Effects**:
    - High winds
    - Storm surge (up to 9-13m) from wind pileup + low pressure
    - Heavy rainfall (>250mm), causing flooding

**Monsoons:**

- Seasonal wind reversals caused by ITCZ migration
- Particularly affect India, northern Australia, West Africa
- Example: India gets dry winds in winter, heavy moisture-laden winds in summer (orographic lifting by Himalayas)

## **Water Properties**

**Molecular Structure:**

- H₂O has 104.5° angle between hydrogen atoms
- **Polar molecule**: electrons spend more time near oxygen (negative end) than hydrogen (positive end)
- Creates electrical charge distribution

**Hydrogen Bonds:**

- Weak bonds between molecules (H attracted to O of neighboring molecule)
- Hold ice crystals in open framework
- Cause ice to be less dense than liquid water (ice floats)
- Give water high surface tension

**Surface Tension:**

- Water molecules pull toward each other
- Creates "skin" effect on water surface
- Allows insects to skate on water
- Forms spherical droplets

**Solvent Properties:**

- Excellent at dissolving ionic compounds (like NaCl)
- Polar water molecules surround and pull apart ions
- Negative ends attract positive ions (Na⁺)
- Positive ends attract negative ions (Cl⁻)

## **pH and Acidity**

**pH Scale:**

- pH = -log[H⁺ concentration]
- Neutral water: pH 7 (concentration = 10⁻⁷)
- Acidic: pH < 7 (more H⁺ ions)
- Alkaline/Basic: pH > 7 (fewer H⁺ ions)

**Examples to know:**

- Battery acid: pH 0-1
- Lemon juice/vinegar: pH 2
- Blood: pH 7.4 (slightly alkaline)
- Seawater: pH ~8
- Drain cleaner: pH 14

**Carbonic Acid:**

- CO₂ + H₂O → H₂CO₃ (carbonic acid)
- Dissociates to release H⁺ ions
- Makes rainwater slightly acidic (pH ~6)
- Important for rock erosion

## **Ice and Phase Changes**

**Ice as a Mineral:**

- Meets all criteria: fixed composition, defined structure, inorganic, naturally occurring solid, crystalline
- Hexagonal crystal structure
- Open lattice structure makes it less dense than water

**Phase Changes:**

- Ice → Liquid → Vapor: requires energy input (breaks hydrogen bonds)
- Vapor → Liquid → Ice: releases latent energy

## **Weathering (Introduction)**

- Modification of geosphere surface by atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere
- **Physical weathering**: Ice expansion in cracks breaks rocks apart
- **Chemical weathering**: Water dissolves minerals

# Lecture 9

# Key Concepts for Your Exam

Based on this lecture, here are the essential concepts you need to understand:

## Weathering and Erosion

**Weathering** refers to changes that happen to rock more or less in place. **Erosion** is the removal and transport of weathered material. These work together but are distinct processes.

**Physical (Mechanical) Weathering** breaks rocks apart without changing their chemistry. The main types are mechanical abrasion (water or wind hurling particles against solid rock) and frost wedging (water freezing in cracks and expanding up to 9%, breaking rocks apart). Frost wedging is especially effective where there are many freeze-thaw cycles.

**Chemical Weathering** changes the chemical composition of rocks. Examples include dissolving salt in water (polar water molecules pull apart ionic compounds), dissolving limestone (especially with acid present - all rainwater is slightly acidic due to dissolved CO₂), and weathering of feldspar to form clay minerals like kaolinite. Chemical weathering happens faster in warm climates and when acids are present.

## Sediment Classification

Clastic sediments (solid rock particles) are classified by size:

- **Mud**: smaller than 1/16 mm (includes clay and silt)
- **Sand**: 1/16 mm to 2 mm
- **Gravel**: larger than 2 mm (includes granules, cobbles, boulders)

**Regolith** is weathered material on Earth's surface. **Soil** is regolith mixed with plant material. Note: Mars and the Moon have regolith but not soil (no plants).

## Sediment Transport in Water

Rivers carry sediment in three ways:

**Dissolved load** consists of invisible ions in solution (like calcium, sodium, bicarbonate) - products of chemical weathering.

**Suspended load** includes small particles (mud and sand) held up by water turbulence, making the water cloudy. These particles rarely touch the bottom.

**Bed load** consists of particles that frequently contact the river bottom. They can slide, roll, tumble, or undergo saltation (jumping). Gravel mostly moves as bed load.

The energy of water flow determines what size particles can be transported. Faster flow = larger particles moved.

## River Characteristics

**Overland flow** is the initial sheet-like movement of water across the surface after soil becomes saturated. It quickly organizes into channels due to positive feedback (deeper areas flow faster, erode more, become even deeper).

**Stream flow** (or channelized flow) occurs once channels form. Rivers receive water from overland flow and **base flow** (groundwater entering through the channel bottom and sides).

**Gradient** measures how steeply a river descends, expressed as degrees, percentage, or meters per kilometer. Rivers typically have a graded profile - steep in headwaters, gentler downstream.

**Velocity** is the speed of water flow (meters per second). Flow is fastest in the middle just below the surface, and on the outside of bends (where erosion is greatest).

**Discharge** is the volume of water passing a point per unit time (cubic meters per second). Calculate it as: **Discharge = velocity × width × depth**. This is a critical measurement for understanding rivers. Note: Never write "CMS" - write m³/s properly.

## River Systems

Rivers organize into **dendritic (tree-like) patterns**. Smaller streams called **tributaries** join to form larger rivers downstream.

**Drainage basins** are areas of land drained by a river system. **Drainage divides** are ridges separating different drainage basins (avoid the ambiguous term "watershed").

**Base level** is the elevation of the water body a river flows into (usually sea level). Rivers flatten as they approach base level.

Rivers can be divided into zones: **headwaters** (mostly erosion, steep), **transfer zone** (mixture of erosion and deposition), and **depositional zone** (near base level, mostly deposition).

## 1. **Downstream Changes in Rivers**

As you move downstream in a river system:

- **Discharge** ↑ (tributaries add water)
- **Width and depth** ↑
- **Gradient** ↓ (slope decreases)
- **Velocity** ↑ slightly (counterintuitive!)
- **Erosion ability** ↓ (less able to move coarse sediment)

**Typical gradients:**

- Mountain stream: ~60 m/km
- North Saskatchewan (Edmonton): 0.3 m/km
- River mouth: <0.1 m/km

## 2. **Three River Zones**

|Zone|Process|Result|
|---|---|---|
|**Headwaters**|Down-cutting|Valley gets deeper|
|**Middle sections**|Lateral erosion|Valley gets wider|
|**Near base level**|Deposition|Floodplain builds up|

---

## 3. **Mass Wasting (Slope Processes)**

**Rockfall:** Individual blocks fall → accumulate as **scree/talus**

**Slides:** Material moves as a mass

- _Translational_: stays in same orientation
- _Rotational_: curved surface, material bends

**Flows:** Material churned/swirled

- _Rock avalanche_: dry, supported by compressed air (Frank Slide, 1903)
- _Debris flow_: wet, catastrophic
- _Lahar_: hot debris flow from volcano

**Creep:** Very slow downslope movement

- Evidence: curved tree trunks
- _Solifluction_: creep from freeze-thaw cycles

---

## 4. **Stream Capture (Stream Piracy)**

- **Headward erosion** causes rapidly down-cutting rivers to capture water from other streams
- Leaves behind empty valleys (example: Deep Hollow, Nova Scotia)

---

## 5. **River Channel Types**

### **Braided Rivers**

- Multiple channels joining/rejoining
- **High** slope (>0.5 m/km)
- **High** sediment load
- Little vegetation
- Coarse sediment (gravel/sand)
- Common near glaciers and in deserts

### **Meandering Rivers**

- Single sinuous channel (high **sinuosity**)
- **Low** gradient
- Fine sediment (sand/mud)
- **Erosion** on outside of bend (**cut bank**)
- **Deposition** on inside (**point bar**)
- Meanders migrate outward and downstream
- Can create **oxbow lakes** when neck cuts through

---

## 6. **Floodplain Features**

**Natural levees:** Ridges along riverbanks from repeated flooding

- Thickest sediment deposited on banks
- Fine sediment spreads across floodplain

**Flooding patterns:**

- **10-year flood** = 10% chance each year (NOT every 10 years!)
- Recurrence intervals are statistical averages
- Can happen more or less frequently than predicted

---

## 7. **Depositional Landforms**

**Alluvial fan:**

- Fan-shaped deposit where steep river flattens
- Forms **on land**
- Gravel and sand (no mud)
- **Distributaries** spread across fan

**Delta:**

- Forms where river enters **sea or lake**
- Similar to alluvial fan but less steep
- Named after Nile Delta (triangular like Greek letter Δ)

**Estuary:**

- Wide river mouth
- Forms where tides are strong OR sea level rising
- Seawater and freshwater mix

---

## 8. **Base Level Changes**

**Causes:** sea level change, tectonic activity, lava flows, landslides, glaciers, land rebound

**Results:**

- **River terraces:** stepped surfaces on valley sides
- **Incised meanders:** meandering river cutting down into bedrock (North Saskatchewan River in Edmonton)
- **Superimposed drainage:** river ignores geology because it developed on older, buried surface (Susquehanna River)

---

## 9. **Lakes**

### **Open Lakes**

- Inlet AND outlet
- **Fresh water** (continuous flushing)
- Stable water levels
- Precipitation > evaporation
- Sediments: mud, sand, gravel near shore

### **Closed Lakes**

- Inlet but NO outlet
- Water leaves by **evaporation only**
- **Saline** (salty) - dissolved ions accumulate
- Evaporation > precipitation
- **Salt deposits** form
- Example: Great Salt Lake

**Lakes are temporary:**

- Obstacles erode away
- Fill with sediment
- May evaporate or drain through sinkholes

---

## Key Terms to Know

- **Base level:** The lowest point a river can erode to
- **Sinuosity:** How curved/winding a river is
- **Discharge:** Volume of water flowing past a point
- **Bed load vs. suspended load vs. dissolved load**
- **Distributaries** (spreading out) vs. **tributaries** (joining together)
- **Nick points:** Steps in river profile (often at dams/lakes)

# Groundwater Exam Study Summary

## Core Definitions & Measurements

**Groundwater** is water that flows through pore spaces in rocks beneath Earth's surface. It represents approximately 23.4 million cubic kilometers of water in the hydrosphere, though this is difficult to measure precisely.

**Porosity** is the percentage (0-100%) or fraction (0-1) of rock volume that consists of pore spaces. Maximum values typically reach low 30% in well-sorted, rounded sand grains. Porosity can be:

- **Primary porosity**: spaces formed when the rock formed
- **Secondary porosity**: spaces formed later (like cracks in granite)

**Permeability** measures how easily water flows through rock, measured in Darcys or millidarcys. It depends on porosity, pore size, and pore connectivity. Fine-grained muds have low permeability despite potentially high porosity because water is held by surface tension and viscosity near grain surfaces.

## Groundwater Zones

**Vadose Zone** (also called aerated or unsaturated zone): Near-surface zone where pore spaces contain both air and water. Water clings to grains.

**Saturated Zone**: Below the vadose zone, where pore spaces are entirely filled with water.

**Water Table**: The boundary where water will drain into a well and fill it up. It sits slightly below the top of the saturated zone. The water table typically mimics the land surface topography in a subdued form—high under hills, low under valleys, and intersecting the surface at lakes and rivers.

## Water Movement

**Recharge** occurs in high-elevation areas where water enters the subsurface and becomes groundwater.

**Base flow** is groundwater that flows into rivers through the river floor (not from surface runoff).

Groundwater flows from areas of high water table elevation to low elevation, driven by gravity and pressure. Flow is much slower than surface water—timescales range from days to millennia depending on depth and permeability.

## Aquifers

An **aquifer** is any saturated body of rock containing water pure enough to be useful to humans.

**Unconfined (water table) aquifer**: Has a water table at its top and a confining layer below. When pumped, it creates a **cone of depression** (drawdown in the water table).

**Confined (artesian) aquifer**: Trapped between two confining layers (low permeability). Water is under pressure and may fountain to the surface when tapped. The recharge area is typically in distant mountains.

**Confining layers** (aquicludes) are low-permeability layers that restrict water flow, often fine-grained sediments like mud.

## Springs & Stream Interactions

**Springs** occur where the water table intersects the land surface, often at geological boundaries between permeable and impermeable rock.

**Losing streams** lose water to groundwater; **gaining streams** receive water from groundwater. **Disappearing streams** flow into the subsurface through holes.

## Dissolution & Karst Features

Groundwater dissolves rock, especially in limestone, gypsum, and rock salt. Dissolution rate depends on pH (lower pH = more acidic = faster dissolution), rock type, and temperature.

**Karst topography** develops in soluble rock areas and includes sinkholes (closed depressions), caves, disappearing streams, and tower karst (steep-sided valleys).

## Water Quality

**Salinity** measures dissolved minerals (parts per million or ppm):

- **Fresh water**: <1,000 ppm (<0.1%)
- **Brackish water**: 1,000-10,000 ppm (0.1-1%)
- **Saline water**: 10,000-35,000 ppm (1-3.5%, like seawater)
- **Brine**: >35,000 ppm (>3.5%)

Slower-flowing groundwater and deeper, older water (connate water) tend to have higher salinity.

## Mineral Precipitation

**Cement** refers to any minerals that crystallize in pore spaces from groundwater, whether or not they glue rocks together.

In caves (vadose zone), evaporating water precipitates minerals forming:

- **Stalactites**: hang from ceiling (C for ceiling)
- **Stalagmites**: grow from floor (G for ground)

**Veins** are cracks filled with minerals. **Geodes** are spaces partly filled with minerals, often showing visible crystals. **Hydrothermal water** (hot groundwater) can dissolve and deposit a wider variety of minerals than cold water.

## **FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS**

### **Cryosphere**

- **Definition**: The "sphere of ice" (from Greek _kuros_)
- Treated as part of the **hydrosphere** (exchanges water with other parts)
- **Components**: ice sheets, ice shelves, sea ice, glaciers, snow, permafrost
- **Residence times**: snow (days/months) → glaciers (years/centuries) → ice sheets (hundreds of thousands of years)

---

## **SNOW & SNOW LINE**

### **Snow Line (Perennial Snow Boundary)**

- Separates **permanent snow** from **seasonal snow**
- **Elevation varies by**:
    - Temperature (lower near poles)
    - Humidity (lower in coastal areas with more moisture)
- Example: Pacific side of BC mountains has lower snow line than prairie side

### **Snow Cover Trends**

- Decreasing globally (~2% smaller in 2011-2020 vs 1972-1981)
- Spring snow melts **19 days earlier** in USA than in 1972
- Impacts: shorter ski seasons, less natural irrigation for agriculture

---

## **GLACIER FORMATION: SNOW → ICE**

|Stage|Air Content|Density (g/cc)|
|---|---|---|
|Fresh snow|~90%|<0.1|
|Ice granules|~50%|0.3-0.5|
|Granular ice|~30%|0.5-0.7|
|Glacier ice|10-20% (trapped bubbles)|Higher|

**Key point**: Trapped air bubbles in ancient ice preserve atmospheric composition from hundreds of thousands of years ago!

---

## **GLACIER BASICS**

### **Definition**

- Large accumulation of **perennial ice**
- Flows under its **own weight** due to gravity
- Covers ~10% of Earth's land surface

### **Flow Characteristics**

- **Laminar flow** (NOT turbulent like rivers)
- Ice flows via **plastic deformation** under pressure
- Generally flows **downhill** (but can move slightly uphill at base)

---

## **CRITICAL GLACIER ZONES**

### **Equilibrium Line (Snow Line)**

**Most important concept for understanding glaciers!**

- **Above**: **Zone of Accumulation** (net ice gain)
- **Below**: **Zone of Ablation** (net ice loss)
- At the line: flow lines parallel to surface
- Visually: boundary between white (snowy) and dark (glassy) ice

### **Mass Balance**

- **Positive mass balance**: Accumulation > Ablation → glacier **advances**
- **Negative mass balance**: Accumulation < Ablation → glacier **retreats**

**⚠️ EXAM TIP**: Glacier "retreat" does NOT mean ice flows backward! Ice continues flowing forward but melts faster than it's replenished, so the glacier front moves uphill.

---

## **GLACIER MOVEMENT MECHANISMS**

### **Cold-Based Glaciers**

- Frozen to bedrock
- Movement: **Ice deformation only**

### **Warm-Based Glaciers** (3 mechanisms)

1. **Ice deformation** (plastic flow)
2. **Basal sliding** (over rock)
3. **Sediment deformation** (pushing sediment)

**Result**: Warm-based glaciers move **faster** and leave **more landscape evidence**

---

## **GLACIER FEATURES**

### **Crevasses**

- Brittle fractures in upper ice layer
- Form where glacier bends over slope changes
- Dangerous (may be hidden by snow above snow line)

---

## **GLACIER TYPES**

### **Continental Glaciers** (unconfined by topography)

- **Ice Sheets**: Only 2 left
    - **Antarctica**: 90% of world's ice, up to 4km thick, would raise sea level **60m** if melted, started forming ~35 million years ago
    - **Greenland**: Would raise sea level **6-7m** if melted, currently biggest contributor to sea level rise
- **Ice Caps**: <50,000 km² (e.g., Vatnajökull in Iceland)

### **Alpine Glaciers**

- Confined by valleys/topography
- Flow between mountains

### **Ice Shelves**

- **Floating ice** attached to ice sheets
- **Grounding line**: separates grounded ice from floating ice
- Sensitive to climate change (in direct contact with ocean)
- **Calving**: process of iceberg formation
- Important: Help hold back fast-flowing outlet glaciers

---

## **CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTIONS**

- Most glaciers are **retreating** (negative mass balance)
- **Exception**: Some humid coastal glaciers (Norway, coastal Alaska) are **advancing** due to warmer air carrying more moisture → more snow
- Sea level rising **3+ mm/year**:
    - 60% from melting glaciers
    - 40% from thermal expansion of water

---
