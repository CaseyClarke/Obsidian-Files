## Key Exam Concepts from Lecture 1
## Systems Concepts

**Types of Systems:**

- **Isolated system**: Exchanges neither matter nor energy with surroundings (example: the universe; solar system is approximately isolated)
- **Closed system**: Exchanges energy but not matter with surroundings (example: Earth - approximately closed, loses some light gases, gains some meteorite material)
- **Open system**: Exchanges both matter and energy with surroundings (examples: animals, ecosystems, atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, geosphere)

**System Components:**

- **Reservoirs**: Locations where material sits for a period of time in a cycle
- **Fluxes**: The rate at which material moves from one reservoir to another (measured in units per time, like cubic km/year)
- **Residence time**: Average time a molecule spends in each reservoir (calculated by dividing reservoir size by flux rate)

## The Four Major Earth Systems

The atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere - these exchange both matter and energy with each other

## Water Cycle (Hydrologic Cycle)

**Five Main Water Reservoirs (relative sizes matter, not exact numbers):**

1. Oceans - by far the largest (~1-2 billion cubic km)
2. Glaciers and ice - second largest (~25 million cubic km)
3. Groundwater - similar to ice (~23 million cubic km) - most uncertain measurement
4. Surface water (lakes and rivers) - much smaller (~200,000 cubic km)
5. Atmosphere - smallest (~13,000 cubic km)
6. Biosphere (living things) - very small (~1,000 cubic km)

**Key Processes:**

- **Evaporation**: Water moving from surface to atmosphere
- **Transpiration**: Water evaporating from plant leaves
- **Evapotranspiration**: Combined evaporation and transpiration from land
- **Precipitation**: Rain and snow falling from atmosphere

**Important Flux Concepts:**

- Total water entering atmosphere ≈ total water leaving atmosphere (~500,000 cubic km/year)
- More precipitation falls on land than evaporates from it
- The difference (~40,000 cubic km/year) returns to ocean via rivers and groundwater
- Residence time in atmosphere: 1-2 weeks
- Residence time in oceans: several thousand years

**Climate Change Impact:**

- Glacier reservoir is shrinking (more melting than snow accumulation)
- Ocean reservoir is growing (causing sea level rise)
- When reservoirs change size, fluxes in and out don't balance exactly

**Human Impact:**

- ~11% of total runoff is directly diverted by humans (~4,400 cubic km/year)
- Over 25% of land precipitation undergoes evapotranspiration from human-dominated landscapes

## Solar System Concepts

**Formation:**

- Solar system formed ~4.567 billion years ago (4,567 MA or 4.567 GA)
- Condensed from a nebula (cloud of gas and dust) by gravitational attraction
- Formed as a disk with the Sun in the middle

**Orbital Mechanics:**

- Objects orbit due to balance between inertia (Newton's first law) and gravitational force
- **Gravity**: Force inversely proportional to the square of distance
- Orbits are ellipses (not perfect circles)
- **Perihelion**: Point closest to the Sun in an orbit
- **Aphelion**: Point farthest from the Sun

**Kepler's Laws:**

- Planets orbit in ellipses with the Sun at one focus
- Planets sweep out equal areas in equal times (move faster when closer to Sun)
- **Kepler's Third Law**: Period squared is proportional to distance cubed (P² ∝ D³)
- Planets farther from Sun take longer to orbit

**Temperature and Composition:**

- Solar nebula was hottest in the middle, cooler toward edges
- Inner planets lost hydrogen and helium (too hot to retain light gases)
- Outer planets retained hydrogen and helium

**Key Objects:**

- Comets: Best samples of original solar nebula, contain ice and volatile materials
- **Astronomical Unit (AU)**: Distance from Earth to Sun (~200,000 km)

## General Concepts to Understand

- The difference between positive and negative feedbacks in Earth systems
- Earth's distance from Sun affects energy received, but Earth's axial tilt controls seasons more than distance
- Earth is currently closest to Sun in January, farthest in July
- When viewing solar system from above Earth's North Pole, objects orbit counterclockwise

# Key Exam Concepts from Lecture 2

Based on the learning outcomes mentioned at the beginning of the lecture, here are the main concepts you'll need to understand:

## Scientific Method Terminology

You need to differentiate between **hypotheses, theories, scientific laws, principles, and models**. A hypothesis is a testable idea about how observations are related. If it survives multiple tests and explains many phenomena, it becomes a theory. A theory that's highly trusted and can be expressed concisely (often mathematically) may be called a scientific law. A principle is a hypothesis that works most of the time but has well-understood exceptions.

Models are simplified versions of natural systems, either physical constructions or computer simulations. The example given was climate models that divide the atmosphere into cubes.

## Scientific Notation

You should understand exponential format for expressing very large and very small numbers (like 3.155 × 10⁷ seconds in a year). Also important is expressing uncertainty in measurements, such as 2,661 ± 2 MA (million years ago).

## Key Examples to Remember

**Newton's Laws vs Einstein's Relativity**: Newton's laws work well at normal speeds but needed modification by Einstein for objects moving near the speed of light. This shows how scientific theories evolve but aren't necessarily "wrong."

**Continental Drift vs Plate Tectonics**: Alfred Wegener proposed continental drift, but it was controversial because it required the ocean floor to be soft and squishy. Plate tectonics (1960s-70s) explained the same observations better by proposing rigid plates with movement along narrow boundaries.

**Principle of Stratigraphic Superposition**: In sedimentary rock layers, the order of deposition is from bottom to top. However, this principle has exceptions (like igneous intrusions), which is why it's called a principle rather than a law.

## Paradigms and Scientific Revolutions

A paradigm is a new theory combined with new ways of observing and thinking about the world. Thomas Kuhn popularized this term. Plate tectonics is a good example, developed partly due to military ocean floor mapping and nuclear test monitoring networks in the 1950s-60s.

## Earth Science Characteristics

Earth science differs from experimental sciences like physics and chemistry in several ways:

- Mostly based on field observations in natural environments that can't be controlled
- Deals with extreme lengths of time (Ka = thousands of years ago, MA = millions, GA = billions)
- Limited scope for experiments due to time scales involved

**Uniformitarianism vs Actualism**: James Hutton's original uniformitarianism (1795) was too strict, claiming nothing happened in the past that we can't observe today. The modern version, **actualism**, states that the natural laws operating today are the same as in the past, but conditions and environments can change. The key phrase is "the present is the key to the past."

## Earth Science Subdisciplines

While you don't need to memorize all of them, be aware that Earth science includes paleontology, geophysics, geochemistry, oceanography, atmospheric science, and many others.
