# Question 1

(a)

$dim(domain) = dim(nullity) + dim(rank)$
$\Rightarrow 4 = dim(nullity) + dim(rank)$
$\Rightarrow dim(kernal) = dim(nullity) = 4 - dim(rank)$
Rank can be $(0,6)$ but $5,6$ are impossible as they give dimensions less than 0
$\therefore dim(kernal) \in (0,4)$

(b)

$dim(domain) = dim(nullity) + dim(rank)$
$\Rightarrow 4 = dim(nullity) + dim(rank)$
$\Rightarrow dim(kernal) = dim(nullity) = 6 - dim(rank) \implies \leq 6$
$\therefore dim(kernal) \in (0,6)$
