(a)

Any polynomial in $R[x]$ can be written in the form $a_0 + a_1x^1 + a_2x^2 + \dots + a_nx^n$
However any polynomial with degree $> 0$ cannot be inverted in $R[x]$ as the inverse would have negative exponents which do not lie in $R[x]$ as the degree of the polynomial must be positive so we can only take the case of $p(x) = a$ for some constant $a \in R$ since this "polynomial" is actually just some element in R we can say that any $p(x)$ in $R[x]$ is only invertible if $a$ is invertible in R
